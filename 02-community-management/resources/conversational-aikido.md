## Conversational Aikido

Aikido is a very defensive martial art. It's about recognizing and redirecting the flow of energy in kind of a dance between the two of you. The objective is essentially to get your opponent, called a "partner" in Aikido, to see that violence, or attacking you, is futile. So it's kind of more like fighting to a draw, instead of actually fighting to win. So the way that I like to think of this technique is as conversational aikido. And in aikido, there's four steps in every maneuver. Those four steps are: conflict, awareness, blending, and resolution.

### Conflict & Awareness:
Basically, is there a difference of opinion? Aikido is about awareness. Sometimes people just argue even when they're agreeing, so before you step in, you have to be aware whether there's really a conflict or not. You recognize that through awareness. Basically, you listen. You strive to understand not just the issue at hand but the people behind it and their motivations.

### Blending
Blending is really the heart of aikido. Essentially, the objective here is to move out of the line of fire. The best description of aikido for me was, if somebody's trying to stab you, don't be so rude as to stand in their way. They're obviously trying to shove the knife in a certain direction. So get out of their way and let them do it, right? The way I remember this is they can't attack you if you're behind them. And once you're out of the line of fire, take their side.

We apply this to conversational aikido in that we respectfully and sincerely agree. You can always find some common ground. And you can use phrases like, "I understand that," or, "I know it's frustrating when," or things like that. And when you're agreeing with someone, when you're both going the same direction, you can influence them left or right. Most people just bash heads, they disagree and they want to prove the other wrong. This changes nothing, the conflict remains.

### Resolution

Keep in mind, discussions don't have to be zero-sum games. And so there doesn't have to be a winner and a loser. You can both win if you basically just kind of both get on the same side and go the same, or similar, directions, right? But sometimes talking is the problem.

And sometimes you're the problem. Sometimes you're burnt out. You're stressed. So the idea is to just kind of put down the keyboard and nobody gets hurt. Sometimes you just need to take a break. And rarely any subject is so important that it requires your response. And the things that do require a response, generally don't require it right now. 

So you can always take a step back because nobody is going to die because you didn't respond to a message board post. So just take a break. And then come back to it a few hours later, after you've eaten, after you've taken a nap or what have you, gotten a good night's sleep, gone to see a movie, whatever, and then come back and come back to it fresh.

## Extinction

There's this management technique called extinction. And it's a strategy for discouraging undesirable behavior. And note that I'm talking about undesirable behavior and not improper behavior. These are patterns that are negative, but otherwise salvageable. We're not talking about trolls: we will deal with them next. 

Extinction is when you're in a room with somebody and they act out or they do something that's, like I say, undesirable. You just stop talking. There's a reason why it's called an uncomfortable silence. People, at least in the Western world, get uncomfortable with that silence. And it calls out the behavior, but without targeting a particular person. And so it discourages them from acting out in that way. But it also doesn't publicly shame them.

It's a little bit tougher to do online. But if you're a reasonably active participant, people will notice when you stop participating. Especially if it's in a thread that you have been participating in so far. And you just kind of, "Oh, yeah, I've been talking to you until, yeah, you crossed that line and now this is unproductive and I'm not talking to you anymore." And people will figure it out.

## Trolls

But there's times when it's people that intentionally just don't get it. So how can we recognize that intent, and separate it from honest actions? Trolls have common features. They are disrespectful. They attack the person and not the idea. This is moderation 101. That's the easiest way to recognize when somebody is being a troll or, at least, just being rude. I tend to equate the two of them. Also, trolls are inflexible. They refuse to acknowledge conflicting information. The point of a discussion is to exchange ideas. And when people just keep arguing a point over, and over, and over again, probably they're a troll.

They're also argumentative and demanding. They want you to justify yourself to them. They're taking the dominant role in the conversation. And it's like, "I don't have to justify myself to you. Step off." And then they defend all of this with, "Free speech," and, "Others are too sensitive." If you're unable to stop yourself from hurting people, we have some words for that.

So how do we deal with trolls once we've recognized them? Well, as a user, you really have kind of limited options. You can notify administrators and hope they take care of it or just walk away. But you should, and you have the right to expect that moderators should, step one, call out the behavior by issuing an official warning and make it clear - and this is important - make it clear that your interpretation of the behavior is not up for debate because a lot of times, people will try and turn it around on the moderator. 

They'll say, "Oh, no. You're being rude by calling out my behavior," or, "Why is this behavior not okay?" Or they'll try to create a dialog around the moderation. You have to stop that behaviour: your moderation decisions are not up for debate.

Step two is, if it continues, just ban them. You don't have to wring your hands over it. You don't have to worry about it. Just ban them. For every single bad person, they're driving away 20 good people, good people that want to contribute, but turn away from the community because they see these people, and they just don't want to deal with it.

And you can't expect things to get better if there aren't consequences for negative actions and swift and immediate consequences also. The most important thing is the community, not the moderator, not any individual or clique of members. The community is the most important thing because the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.
