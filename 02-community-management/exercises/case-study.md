# Community moderation case study

In this exercise, you will analyse an example of community moderation in light of the techniques you have learnt in this module.

## Task

### Analyse a community you do not manage.

To analyse a community you do not manage will require finding a _visible_ moderation action. Some moderation actions aren't easily visible to viewers after the fact, for example, if a thread is deleted. You may recall some visible techniques from Lee's talk, such as _extinction_.

When analysing a community that you do not manage, here are some things to think about:
- What was the nature of the incident? Was it a bad actor such as a troll, or a well-meaning actor whose interaction turned hostile?
- What techniques did the moderators use to resolve the interaction?
- Was the outcome positive?
- What could they have done differently?


### Analyse a community you manage.

If it is a community you manage, you can analyse one of your own past moderation actions, in light of the contents of this module.

Some prompts may be:
- Did I use the right tool to resolve this conflict?
- Was the outcome the outcome I wanted?
- What could have improved the outcome?

## Completing the exercise

Write your analysis following the below headings:

### Nature of the incident

Tell us about what happened that required moderation?

### Moderation action

How did the moderators resolve the situation? What techniques did they use? Did they use any moderation tools? How did the capabilities of their platform influence their moderation decisions?

### Outcome

What was the outcome of their moderation action? Was it positive for the community?

### What could be different?

Based on what you've learnt in this module, and your analysis of this situation, what could have been done differently to improve the outcome.
