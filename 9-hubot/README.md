## Introduction 👋

In this module, you'll learn about Hubot from GitHub platform engineer, Mark Tareshawty. Hubot is a chatbot framework developed to support the use of _chatops_ at GitHub. This talk details what chatops is, and why it's important to GitHub.

This talk features live examples and interactive exercises, so it is recommended you watch the video. If you are unable to follow the video, you can use the talk transcript in concert with the Hubot docs.

When following a technical workshop in the Campus Expert training, the foremost thing in your mind should be "How can I share this knowledge with my community?". As you participate in the workshops and go through the exercises, think how you can present these concepts to your own peers, and what problems these technologies might solve, that are relevant to your community.

## Exercise 📝

The exercise in this module is to make your first steps with Hubot, via deploying a Hubot and writing a script for it. You can find a full description in the exercises directory.
