# Hubot script

This exercise is to write your first Hubot script! It can be as simple or complex as you are comfortable with, the important thing is to learn about the process of creating one so you are able to use and teach Hubot within your community.

## Task

Deploy a Hubot to an application such as Slack or Discord. You can follow the two guides below to deploy to Slack using Heroku:
- https://slackapi.github.io/hubot-slack/
- https://hubot.github.com/docs/deploying/heroku/

Once your Hubot is deployed, write a [script](https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/) and add it to your Hubot. 

Here's a couple of suggestions:
- Write a Hubot script to rename a GitHub repository.
- Experiment with different Hubot [adapters](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/): try installing a Hubot on Slack, Discord, Facebook messenger. What different scripts might make sense for each platform?
- Does your community use any group messaging platform that has a Hubot adapter? What scripts could your community use?

Once you have written your Hubot script, include it in a file called "module-2.md" and submit it as per the instructions below. You can copy and paste the whole script, or include a link to a gist or repository.
