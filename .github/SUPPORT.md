# Getting Support

You can get support with the Campus Expert training in 3 ways:

### Issues

You can open an issue to get support any time. Please follow the below steps:
- Make your title as descriptive as possible.
- Apply the labels as described in the module README, plus the label "help".
- Follow and complete the ISSUE TEMPLATE.
- The issue template may instruct you to apply further labels. Please do so!
- Check to ensure you are subscribed to the issue, and check your GitHub notification settings, so you get notifications when your question is answered.

### Webinars

For every module, we hold regular webinars to answer questions, and walk through the content.
You can find the calendar of webinars [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/github.com_ei82gchda2egevr7aukq6uj1f0%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).  

Please note that webinars take place through Zoom. The Zoom client will automatically download when you join a call, but you can download in advance and find out more [here](https://zoom.us/download).

### 1-to-1 calls

If you have questions you would like to talk to a trainer face to face about, you can request a video call [here](https://calendly.com/joenash/campus-experts-support). Please ensure you answer all questions in the form, or your call request may be denied.
