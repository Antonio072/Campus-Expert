# Contributing to Campus Experts training

Throughout the training, you might find bugs, typos, or just plain boring content. We welcome contributions and help with making Campus Experts as good as it can be!

However, we want to make sure that you don't waste your valuable time. Before making a large pull request, open an issue describing what you want to fix. This helps us work with you to make sure the PR will be accepted, and your time isn't wasted.

**Remember to search past issues and pull requests in case your question or bug has been commented on before.**
