So yeah. Yeah. So I'm Lee. I've been a professional developer for over 20 years. Yeah, I've been at GitHub for about a year and a half now. And I've been working on Atom for almost four years, so three and a half, something like that. But yeah. So that's not what I'm here to talk about. As I've mentioned, I've been the moderator for Discuss, the official Atom message board, since March of 2014, basically right after Atom Beta was released. I was just kind of helping out on the message board, and they liked what I did. So they said, "Hey, you want to do this officially?" and I said, "Sure, okay." And yeah. So that's how I got started with Atom.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>01:46.709</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">But long, long ago, I had a message board that actually wasn't my modem. But it was a cool picture. So I had a one-line EBS in the early '90s. That was my first experience with moderating. And I've done all kinds of moderation for gaming groups, and message boards, and things like that ever since. So had quite a bit of experience with it. But yeah. So I'm here to talk about community. So how does one build a community? Well, so humans are naturally social creatures. And so there's really just a couple of simple rules. The rules are, don't drive people away, and don't let others drive people away. And then community just kind of happens because humans are social creatures. So how do we avoid driving people away, and how do we stop others? Well, many see forums as an opportunity to do battle. Right? They're just there to wage war. And others only see forums as a place to vent their frustrations. And so we want to create a place where encouragement is the primary topic. So how do we encourage people to work together as a community? Well, one of the ways that we do that is, as moderators, we have to invest some effort to kind of turn negative situations around. And so I have kind of this metaphor that I use. And like many people my age, I grew up on kung fu movies. Basically, every Sunday morning, they had kung fu movies back-to-back for three hours. And I couldn't wait to be old enough to do it myself. So when I got older, I studied two martial arts. And they couldn't have been more different from each other.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:05.041</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">The first was kenpo karate. Kenpo is a very aggressive martial art. And the objective is to destroy your opponent, literally make it so that they are no longer capable of attacking you. My second week, we learned a maneuver called the leap of death. That's really what it's called. And basically, when somebody tries to strike you, you break their arm, throw them on the ground, do a rabbit punch, and jump up and land with your heels in their kidneys, and then basically spit on them as you walk away. Well, we kind of added that last part, but anyway. So that gives you an idea of what kenpo is about.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>05:00.036</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">But after that, I learned aikido. And aikido is a very defensive martial art. It's about recognizing, redirecting the flow of energy in kind of a dance between the two of you. Even the terminology is very different. So instead of an opponent, you call them a partner. But the objective is essentially to get them to see that violence, or attacking you, is futile. So it's kind of more like fighting to a draw, instead of actually fighting to win. So the way that I like to think of this technique is as conversational aikido. And in aiido, there's four steps in every maneuver. So there's conflict, awareness, blending, and resolution. And so conflict. Basically, is there a difference of opinion? Right? And aikido is about awareness. So because sometimes people just argue even when they're agreeing, so you have to be aware-- before you step in, you have to be aware whether there's really a conflict or not. So you recognize that through awareness. Basically, you listen. You strive to understand not just the issue at hand but the people behind it and their motivations.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>06:55.996</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then there's blending. And blending is really the heart of aikido. Essentially, the objective here is to move out of the line of fire. So basically, the best description of aikido for me was, if somebody's trying to stab you, don't be so rude as to stand in their way. They're obviously trying to shove the knife in a certain direction. So you get out of their way and let them do it. Right? So basically, the way I remember this is they can't attack you if you're behind them. And once you're out of the line of fire, take their side. Right? Basically, respectfully and sincerely agree. You can always find some common ground. And you can use phrases like, "I understand that," or, "I know it's frustrating when," or things like that. And so basically, when you're agreeing with someone, when you're both going the same direction, you can influence them left or right, right? But when you use the kenpo approach, which is what most people use, basically you're just beating heads against each other and neither of you go anywhere. So it doesn't change anything.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>08:26.434</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then resolution. Basically, keep in mind, discussions don't have to be zero-sum games. And so there doesn't have to be a winner and a loser. You can both win if you basically just kind of both get on the same side and go the same, or similar, directions, right? But sometimes talking is the problem. And so sometimes you're the problem, right? Basically, sometimes you're burnt out. You're stressed. So the idea is to just kind of put down the keyboard and nobody gets hurt, right? Sometimes you just need to take a break. And rarely any subject is so important that it requires your response. And the things that do require a response, generally don't require it right now. So you can always take a step back because basically, nobody is going to die because you didn't respond to a message board post. So just take a break, right? And then come back to it a few hours later, after you've eaten, after you've taken a nap or what have you, gotten a good night's sleep, gone to see a movie, whatever, and then come back and come back to it fresh.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>09:56.777</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then I learned this one little trick. Also, there's this management technique called extinction. And it's a strategy for discouraging undesirable behavior. And note that I'm talking about undesirable behavior and not improper behavior. So basically, these are patterns that are negative, but otherwise salvageable. Right? So not trolls. We'll get to them in a little bit. So extinction, basically, is when you're in a room with somebody and they act out or they do something that's, like I say, undesirable. You just stop talking. There's a reason why it's called an uncomfortable silence. People, at least in the Western world, get uncomfortable with that. And it calls out the behavior, but without targeting a particular person. And so it discourages them from acting out in that way. But it also doesn't publicly shame them. So it's a little bit tougher to do online. But basically, if you're a reasonably active participant, people will notice when you stop participating. Right? And so especially if it's in a thread that you have been participating in so far. Right? And you just kind of, "Oh, yeah, I've been talking to you until, yeah, you crossed that line and now this is unproductive and I'm not talking to you anymore." And people will figure it out.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>11:54.204</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">But there's times when it's people that intentionally just don't get it. So how can we recognize that intent, and separate it from honest actions? Basically, trolls have common features. They are disrespectful. They attack the person and not the idea. This is moderation 101. Basically, that's the easiest way to recognize when somebody is being a troll or, at least, just being rude. I tend to equate the two of them. But yeah. That's me. Also, trolls are inflexible. Right? Basically, they refuse to acknowledge conflicting information. Right? The point of a discussion is to exchange ideas. And when people just keep arguing a point over, and over, and over again, probably they're a troll. They're also argumentative and demanding. So, "Why is Atom so slow? Why CoffeeScript? Why this? Why that?" Right? Basically, they want you to justify yourself to them. Basically, they're taking the dominant role in the conversation. And it's like, "I don't have to justify myself to you. Step off." And then they defend all of this with, "Free speech," and, "Others are too sensitive." Yeah. If you're unable to stop yourself from hurting people, we have some words for that, like asshole. And so yeah.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>13:52.400</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So how do we deal with trolls once we've recognized them? Well, as a user, you really have kind of limited options. Basically, you can notify administrators and hope they take care of it or just walk away. But you should, and you have the right to expect that moderators should, step one, call out the behavior by issuing an official warning and make it clear - and this is important - make it clear that your interpretation of the behavior is not up for debate because a lot of times, people will try and turn it around on the moderator. They'll say, "Oh, no. You're being rude by calling out my behavior," or, "Why is this behavior not okay?" Or they'll try to-- basically they'll try to create a dialog around the moderation of, "No, Stop. This is not up for debate." And then step two is, if it continues, just ban them. Right? You don't have to wring your hands over it. You don't have to worry about it. Just ban them. For every single bad person, they're driving away 20 good people, good people that want to contribute, but turn away from the community because they see these people, and they just don't want to deal with it. And you can't expect things to get better if there aren't consequences for negative actions and swift and immediate consequences also. So the thing to remember is, the most important thing is the community, not the moderator, not any individual or clique of members. The community is the most important thing because the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one. So thanks. That's my presentation.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>16:03.904</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Awesome.

But cool, so just make sure to not kick people and be nice. Okay, cool. So what's some ways that we can increase kind of community engagement? Or what are some ways that we can bring more of the community into actually actively participating in whatever platform or whatever?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>16:48.810</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So yeah. So there's some ratios that have been fairly firmly established, which is 90, 9, and 1, which is basically 90% of the community will just lurk or just watch. They will solely consume. The 9% will participate. Typically, they'll comment on things. And then 1% will actually produce things. So like in the case, Flickr was the one that originally kind of established this. And so 90% will just look at the pictures, 9% will comment on pictures, and 1% will actually produce pictures. In message boards, it's a little bit similar. Basically, 90% of the community will just read, 9% will comment on other people's posts, and then basically 1% will kind of start their own posts. So there's really not much you can do to change those ratios. They're pretty fixed throughout the industry, and it's basically just kind of human behavior, as far as we can tell. So basically, the only thing that you can do is just kind of try to increase the size of your community. And one of the ways to do that is to basically just make it welcoming. Right? Kick out the bad people. And try to get the word about your community and let people know that they have somebody to come to if they have a problem.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>18:46.380</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Anyone else have a question?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S4<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>18:49.730</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">I have a quick question.

So basically, the main thing to keep in mind is that - and this is what I call a kind of a confederation of communities - the basically, individual communities will have different cultures. And sometimes those cultures will clash. Basically, let's say for the sake of argument, the Young Republicans Club will clash with the Feminists Club, right? And not necessarily, but possibly. Right? And so just kind of maybe putting them on opposite sides of the quad, or whatever, might be good. But also, the main thing, I think, is just establishing the ground rules, kind of making sure there's a code of conduct, and making sure everybody's aware of it, and making sure that people will be held to the code of conduct, and they won't be invited back, right? If it's just a one-time event, then it's a little bit harder because a lot of the thing-- a lot of the teeth of a code of conduct is that, basically, you won't be invited to the next one, right? And if it's a useful event for people to showcase their club, then they want to be invited to the next one, right? So yeah. So I hope that helps.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S4<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>21:29.873</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Definitely helpful.

And again, you've touched on this, like, "Just ban them [laughter]." But I think one of the things we spoke about, particularly before, is letting the community drive the direction of the community and when that responsibility should be with the community members versus when it should be with you. And I know you've written a post about this as well. I think it was called Voting One. I don't know if I've actually formulated the question there, but I think you quite know what I'm talking about. Maybe talk to me a little bit about that, like when it's appropriate to kind of grab the steering wheel and when it's important to kind of give some direction back to the members.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>22:18.241</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So in almost all cases, it's important to let the community guide itself. The point of being a moderator is to moderate things, not necessarily to force things in a particular direction. So letting the community kind of pick its own direction is really, really important. And you're just there to kind of create a framework so that people can have positive interactions. One of the other things, kind of-- sometimes conversations die out. And so sometimes people-- somebody needs to step in and a moderator's good to do that stepping in and kicking off the next conversation. But for the most part, if conversations are continuing, then just let them continue as long as they're positive, and nobody's getting upset about things, and yeah. So yeah. Most of the time, if you've got enough people together, conversations and interactions will be self-sustaining.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>23:37.547</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Someone else have any other questions?

I was just wondering what your take was of different tools of-- when is it more appropriate to maybe use something like a forum, or when is it maybe more appropriate to use something that's more just like Facebook where it's just sort of you put something up and you can get a few comments on it? What are your experiences with the different tools?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>24:10.581</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So personally, you should be using all of them. Use all the tools. Basically, different people prefer to communicate in different ways. So some people will just hang out on Slack and won't use Facebook. Some people use Facebook and not hang out on Slack. Some people will do both. Some people prefer in-person interactions. So you basically should be investigating multiple ways for your community to communicate and trying to kind of create ways for those communication mediums to cross over. So if you can have a bot that will kind of say, "Hey, this is a popular post on the Facebook group," and once a day kind of pipe up and say, "Hey people, check out this new thing on the Facebook group." Or vice versa, right? Basically, "Here's the log of an interesting interaction on Slack." And post that to Facebook. And so kind of encouraging cross-pollination of ideas that you don't get idea islands, for lack of a better term.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>25:25.566</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And you need to [crosstalk]--<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S5<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>25:26.789</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Awesome.

So why we settled on it? Basically, that decision was made for me. I wasn't part of the team before that was chosen. So yeah. But I love it. I think Discourse is, by far, the best message board software that I've seen in my 20 years of experience, so actually, more than that, but I'll stop there. And basically, the main reason is they gave a lot of thought to the moderation flow, basically, making it simple, making it easy for moderators to keep things positive, keep things moving, and organizing your message board, and things like that. So there's lots of other platforms that people use. But pretty much every other platform, besides Discourse, has a huge moderation problem. And GitHub is just as guilty, right? There's tons of internal conversations that I have around trying to make moderation on GitHub better. So yeah. Basically, if you can migrate your community to Discourse for forums, then I would strongly, strongly recommend it because you will find that basically, community interactions are just better, so.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>27:42.358</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Are there any other questions because I have a totally off-topic one to ask [laughter].

But what's your take on that?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>28:13.146</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So actually, they did add badges to some slight gamification mechanisms to Discourse. But I do kind of agree with Jeff Atwood, one of the codesigners of Stack Overflow and the head of Discourse, in that you don't want to just willy-nilly incentivize posting. Basically, you want to incentivize reading because basically, people want to be heard, right? And so lots of people will come and just kind of not read the thread and then post their comments on it. Maybe they'll read the first couple of sentences of the first post and then drop to the bottom and go, "Rawr," right? And that's not what you want, right? What you want is for people to read the entire thread and then post cogent thoughts and things that will actually move the conversation forward. So there's stuff built in to Discourse around trust levels, which basically the way to get from trust level zero, a brand new user, to trust level one is to actually read for ten minutes. You can't make it to trust level one without reading. And most of the gates between trust levels are centered around reading. Posting is a very, very tiny part of it. And I kind of agree with that. And so a lot of the other ones are around liking. And so yeah. Basically, so I have a-- I should have added it to my presentation. But I have a repository on GitHub, GitHub.com/lee-dom/community/manager. And - excuse me - in there are links to, well basically, a bunch of my writings and a bunch of other people's writings. But there's one where Jeff Atwood talks about why they designed Discourse around incentivizing reading. I forget what the title is, but it's one of the-- all of Jeff Atwood's links in that README there are worth reading. So yeah. So I would recommend checking those out.

So something that we've seen on video game communities is that they have been constantly attacked by groups of organized trolls, something called also raiding. So for moderators is one of the toughest things to dissipate the attack of a raid.

The brigading and things of that nature-- this is another reason why I like Discourse is because basically, until people read, right, their posts get automatically moderated. And so their posts have to be approved a lot of times. And so basically, that helps with brigading and that sort of thing. Also, it's really super easy to ban people on Discourse. Basically, if you see a post that's problematic, it takes three or four clicks to invoke, what I call, the nuclear option, which basically not only hides the post, but bans the user, their IP address, and their email address forever. And so yeah. And then it takes them five minutes to come back with a new IP address and a new email address, right? But then it takes you another three clicks. And so it's just a war of attrition where time is the resource, and Discourse makes it so that its super fast for you, and it takes them slightly longer. Right? Whereas most other platforms, it takes longer for you to ban somebody than for them to come back with a new identity. Right? So yeah. Unfortunately, the kind of move to Discourse isn't necessarily applicable for everybody. But I would say, yeah, enlist help and ban inscrutably. If people's first post is negative, ban. Right? You have to do what you have to do.

And on that, please join me in thanking Lee [laughter].<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>35:33.120</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Thanks, everybody.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>35:34.354</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">[inaudible].<br /> </p></blockquote></div>
