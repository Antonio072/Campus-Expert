## Introduction üëã

During this module, you will watch a webinar by Lee Dohm. Lee is the community manager for Atom and Electron, two large open source projects, and will be sharing his battle-tested experience with managing large online communities. Lee first presented this talk to the Spring 2017 cohort of Campus Experts.

### Online communities in context

Why are we talking about online communities on a program called Campus Experts? Isn't all of your community on a physical campus, sharing a real world space? Well although your community is based on a campus, making it possible for you to provide offline spaces, these spaces aren't accessible all the time.

Consider a weekly meetup: this is a great facility, but how does collaboration continue in the time between those meetups? And if a member of the community is unable to attend in a given week, and needs support, where do they turn to?

The ability to enable constant collaboration and provide an accessible, always available space is part of what makes online spaces invaluable. Another key benefit is the presence of a written record. If a community member asks a question in a physical space, and receives a great answer, unless they were thoughtful enough to record it and share it instantly, chances are it will be lost to the wider group. Other members who shared similar questions or who may have that question in the future cannot benefit from its answering. With an online space, however, retention and availability of this information is implicit (in most platforms; platforms like the free edition of Slack provide permanent history as a premium feature).

### Types of online spaces

There are lots of different types of online spaces where student groups gather. If there's an application that enables communication amongst a group, chances are someone has made it work for them. A notable example is Hackathon Hackers, a Facebook group of over 50,000 student hackers. Which application you use has many factors. Geography, for example, influences the choice of platform. Just consider how essential WeChat is in China. Some choices just come down to pervasive culture: IRC is very popular with student groups in the city of Edinburgh for instance.

When it comes to choosing a platform for your online space though, there is one sure thing to optimise for. You want to choose a platform where your members are gathering regularly anyway. In other words, you want a platform with regular foot traffic. Let me give an example: Facebook is the most popular choice with US students not because it has the best features for online communities or groups, but because those students _use Facebook every day already_.

When the community is already regularly using the platform, it's much easier to get them to visit the community. In contrast, many student groups struggle to leverage Slack, because students don't typically have a good reason to visit Slack every day yet. However, communities focused on professional communities have had great success with Slack, as their members are likely using Slack every day for work, so extending their visit to their favourite community Slack is an easy ask.

### Moderating online spaces

Whichever platform you choose, your ability to moderate effectively should be a core consideration. Some platforms provide more tools than others for moderation.

What do we mean by "moderation"? When we talk about moderation, we mean dealing with bad actors using your community space. This could mean removing spammers and spam posts, removing abusers or trolls, or it could just mean reminding someone that they're talking to other people, and to not be so aggressive. Effective moderation helps promote productive conversations and creates a more welcoming space.

Although having the ability to moderate effectively is a very important consideration when creating a group, that isn't to say that problems requiring moderation are inevitable. It's perfectly possible to have a group that doesn't attract bad actors or a large quantity of spam. However, you should be prepared, utilising tools such as a Code of Conduct, and having a moderation policy in place.

For student tech communities, often the most prolific issue is spam: technical students are considered a valuable audience to many groups and businesses, and they will want to leverage your space for their own purposes, too. Being the line between posts by the community, for the community, and posts by external actors looking to tap the community is a common function of a student group moderator.

Lee's talk covers many tools and techniques for moderating online spaces, and mediating conflict. You can find a summary of useful moderation techniques in the [resources](resources/) directory.

## Exercise üìù

The exercise in this module is to complete a case study of a community moderation action. This can be for a community you manage, or an external community such as a Facebook group or message board. Both options are described in detail in the exercise.
