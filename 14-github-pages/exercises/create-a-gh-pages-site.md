# Create a GitHub Pages Site

Whether you need a site for your community, or a specific active project, GitHub Pages offers you a simple and elegant solution.

## Task

- Identify an active project your community is working on, that would benefit from a public-facing site.
- Alternatively, consider creating a site for your entire community.
- Create the site using one of the options below. They're listed in order of difficulty (easiest first, complex last):
  - [GitHub's theme chooser](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/)
  - [An existing Jekyll theme on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=âœ“&query=jekyll-theme), check that it's [supported by GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
  - A theme directory like [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org), [jekyllrc.org](http://themes.jekyllrc.org), or [jekyll/jekyll's wiki](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/themes)
  - [From scratch](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) or consider porting an existing site using Jekyll.
- Publish your site using a repository and GitHub Pages.
- If desired, [point a custom domain to your GitHub Pages site](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).
- Include a link to your site and the repository in a file titled "module-14.md".
