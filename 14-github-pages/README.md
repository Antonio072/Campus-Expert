## Introduction üëã

In this module, you'll learn about GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is an easy and fast way to create static web pages. A static web page is a page that isn't backed by a web application or server. In other words, there's no back end. This makes GitHub Pages a really easy way to learn about building websites, and to experiment with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

GitHub Pages runs on Jekyll, a Ruby framework for creating static pages. Jekyll provides many tools and utilities that give some of the power of a full featured backend, easily. It's especially well suited for blogs. During this module, you'll also learn about Jekyll, and how to create a Jekyll theme.

Did you know that GitHub Pages powers the Campus Expert website? Take a look at http://githubcampus.expert.

GitHub Pages is a great way to create websites for your community that anyone can contribute to: it's great for club blogs, hackathon information sites, and as a space for your members to experiment. The exercise in this module will have you create your first Pages site for your community. After you've done it, why not host a "Build your first website" workshop on campus using your new knowledge?
