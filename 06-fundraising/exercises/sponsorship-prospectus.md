# Create a sponsorship prospectus

In this exercise, you'll create a sponsorship prospectus based on what you learnt during the module, to help raise funds for your community.

## Task

- Define what you are raising funds for.
  - Is it a community, or an event like a hackathon?
- Design a budget.
  - Work through what items you _need_ and what items are _nice to haves_.
  - Follow Tim's advice on making your budget accessible and usable.
  - Investigate suppliers to inform accurate calculations, and the timeline with which you need to bring money in. I.e. you need to place your tshirt order 2 months out from the event, when do you need to pay for that order?
- Define your sponsorship tiers.
  - What are the break points for each tier?
  - What can you offer your sponsors?
  - How do your tiers vary for the different sponsorship types?
- Investigate the usability of your prospectus.
  - How quickly can a sponsor find the information they need?
  - What is the minimum amount of information needed to be useful?
  - What kinds of sponsors need more background information?
