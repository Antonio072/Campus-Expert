## Introduction
In this module, you'll hear from Tim Fogarty, former commissioner for Major League Hacking, now a developer advocate at mLab. Tim delivered a very comprehensive talk on fundraising to the Spring 2017 Campus Expert cohort. During this talk, Tim covers generating budgets, including knowing what you should budget for. He covers how to approach sponsors, and what they're looking for, and how to manage those relationships going forward. Finally, he covers sponsorship process, and some tips and tricks.

As this talk is so comprehensive, this is a long talk, and there's a lot of content below and in the transcript. Being able to take on money and fund your activities is important, so if this is too much for you to learn alone, consider involving someone else from your community to help build out your fundraising capacity.

You can read more about budgets, sponsor motivation, creating sponsorship documents and sponsorship process in the [resources](resources/) directory.

## Exercise 📝

The exercise for this module is to create a sponsorship prospectus for an event or your club. That is going to involve defining what you're raising funds for, designing a budget, and creating tiers that form your final document. You can find a full description in the exercises directory.
