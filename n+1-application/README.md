## Introduction 👋

This module is the application to become a Campus Expert. You should only follow this module if you have completed the following:

- Module 0 - Getting Started.
- Module 1 - Introduction.
- At least 3 other modules (not including the Application module).

Please bear in mind the following requirements:

- Campus Experts must be 18 years of age and over.
- You must not be within 3 months of finishing your course of study.
- There is a limit to the number of Campus Experts per university. This limit is dependent on several factors. If in doubt, please check through one of the support channels listed below.

To apply to become a Campus Expert, complete the exercise. During this exercise, we'll collect some information from you and find a time to have a chat.

Once you submit your application, we'll review your application and let you know as soon as possible whether we are able to make you a full Campus Expert.

## What happens once I'm a Campus Expert? 🤔

Campus Experts get added to a repository where you can request access to resources and ask for help with your activities and events. At the bottom of every training module, you will find a list of perks that you and your community gain access to upon completing that module. Once your application is accepted, you can start to use these benefits.

Being a Campus Expert means making progress towards completing the goals laid out in your community impact proposal. Each month you will complete a report that lays out your progress towards that goal.

Due to the per-campus limit on the number of Campus Experts, Campus Experts that are inactive for a long period of time, or not completing reports, may have their position re-evaluated. If you have concerns about the time commitment of being a Campus Expert, or know in advance you may be unavailable for some period of time, let us know through the support channels below.
