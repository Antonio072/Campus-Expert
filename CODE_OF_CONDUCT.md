# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct Version 1.4

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at joenash@github.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

# Procedure for Handling Harassment

If you feel like you are being harassed or feel uncomfortable and would like to talk to a member of staff, then please follow the following steps so that we can help you as quickly as possible:

(This procedure has been adopted from the [London API code of conduct](https://github.com/phalt/londonapi-code-of-conduct), itself adapted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)".)

1\. Members of the Campus Experts team prepared to handle an incident are identified below. All of our staff are informed of this code of conduct policy and guide
for handling harassment in the repository.

**Campus Experts team**
- Joe Nash, GitHub staff, student program manager. joenash@github.com
- Amy Dickens, Campus Rep for the Midlands, UK. amy@adickens.co.uk
- Wilhelm Klopp, Campus Rep for London, UK. will@ucl.ac.uk

2\. Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a staff member. All reports
are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is for the other students.

When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available but do not
interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (GitHub handle/link to where it occurred) of the participant doing the harassing.
- The behavior that was in violation.
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made).
- The circumstances surrounding the incident.
- Other people involved in the incident.

The staff are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. The Campus Experts team requests that they be your first resource when reporting a Campus Experts-related incident, so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution.

If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to the Campus Experts team mentioned above.

## Staff Procedure for incident handling

All Campus Experts team members will have been briefed on the following procedures for helping you to help with your safety.

(This procedure has been adopted from the [London API code of conduct](https://github.com/phalt/londonapi-code-of-conduct), itself adapted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)".)

Please make sure that you and other organisers have read this document in its entirety to ensure everyone helping to triage this repository is aware of the code of conduct and it's procedures.

Try to get as much of the incident in writing from the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information to gather include the following:

 - Identifying information (GitHub handle/link to place incident occurred) of the participant doing the harassing.
 - The behavior that was in violation.
 - The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made).
 - The circumstances surrounding the incident.
 - Other people involved in the incident.

Prepare an initial response to the incident. This initial response is very important and will set the tone for Campus Experts. Depending on the severity/details of the incident, please follow these guidelines:

 - If there is any general threat to students or the safety of anyone including staff is in doubt, alert the GitHub Security team or law enforcement.
 - Offer the victim a confidential video call.
 - Ask the victim "how can I help?".
 - Provide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later.
 - If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request.

There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:

 - Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
 - Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility.
 - Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff's responsibility.

Once something is reported to a staff member, immediately meet with Joe Nash, the project manager. The main objectives of this meeting is to find out the following:

 - What happened?
 - Are we doing anything about it?
 - Who is doing those things?
 - When are they doing them?

After the staff meeting and discussion, have a staff member communicate with the alleged harasser. Make sure to inform them of what has been reported about them.

Allow the alleged harasser to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged harasser know what actions will be taken against them.

Some things for the staff to consider when dealing with Code of Conduct offenders:

- Warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions.
- Requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with their victim for the remainder of their participation in the program.
- Ending a talk that violates the policy early.
- Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy.
- Not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event now or in the future.
- Closing an issue or pull request that violates the policy.
- Not allowing a commenter who violates the policy to comment on issues or pull requests in the future.
- Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds.
- Requiring that the harasser not volunteer for future Campus Expert activities (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).
- Requiring that the harasser immediately leave the project and not return.
- Banning the harasser from future events and programs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).
- Removing a harasser from membership of relevant organisations and repositories.
- Publishing an account of the harassment and calling for the resignation of the harasser from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the harasser is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn't as useful).

Give accused attendees a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the report stands. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to encourage an apology from the harasser.

It is very important how we deal with the incident publicly. Our policy is to make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that it is not according to policy and that official action has been taken - while still respecting the privacy of individual attendees. When speaking to individuals (those who are aware of the incident, but were not involved with the incident) about the incident it is a good idea to keep the details out.

Depending on the incident, the repository owner may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement through the announcements issue, or project README. No one other than the repository owner or someone delegated authority from the repository owner should make any announcements. No personal information about either party will be disclosed as part of this process.

If some attendees were angered by the incident, it is best to apologize to them that the incident occurred to begin with. If there are residual hard feelings, suggest to them to write an email to the conference chair or to the event coordinator. It will be dealt with accordingly.
