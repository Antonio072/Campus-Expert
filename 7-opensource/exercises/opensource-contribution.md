# Making an opensource contribution

In this module, you heard about the value of opensource and some tips for getting involved. This exercise is to make an opensource contribution.

## Task

Contribute to an opensource repository. Your contribution could be code, documentation, or something else entirely.

Here's some tips:
- Contribute to a project you use. Does the project lack something you want, or does it have a bug?
- Look for beginner friendly issues. Many repositories maintain ["first-timer-only"](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) labels: this label signifies that a bug is friendly for first time contributors.
- Make use of programs like Hacktoberfest and 24PullRequests. You can find a full list in the README.md.
- Is there a project by the community you could contribute to?
- Consider contributing to [github/training-kit](https://github.com/github/training-kit), the repo for GitHub's [On Demand training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/).
- Interested in practicing with GitHub Apps or Probot? [Teacherbot](https://github.com/teacher-bot/teacherbot) would be glad to have your contributions!
- We welcome contributions to Campus Expert projects! Check out the [organisation](https://github.com/campus-experts) for more.
