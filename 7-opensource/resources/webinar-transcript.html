So today I'm want to talk a little bit about how open source can impact your career and open up a bunch of opportunities. And I think what's gotten me interested in this topic is, as a developer-- so I've been at GitHub for about five years and was doing development for about five years before that as well. And consistently what I've seen is that some of the best developers that I know and some of the most successful developers that I know have arrived where they are because of their participation in open source. Working on open-source projects and in open-source communities has helped them learn, helped them gain experience, build a reputation, and then often end up finding a really great job. And so I started asking them recently, "How has open source impacted your career?" Well, first of all, everyone that I asked this to was really excited to share because, for most of them, it's been a really strong experience either way. There's been tons and tons of great things that have come out of it. But then they were also quick to share some of the challenges that they face. So I'm not going to talk so much about some of those challenges, but I'll be happy to at the end if you want to dive into it, to Q&A around it. But often, everyone that I asked came back with these really, really long posts. In fact, some of them actually went and wrote blog posts which will kind of illustrate a point that I'll get to in a little bit. But they came back with things saying like, "I would not be where I was if it weren't for open source." "I believe all of my career opportunities have come from this." "I met some of the people that I now work with because of my participation in open source." And so this theme came up time and time again.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>01:42.178</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Matthew Garrett, who's a well-known Linux developer, said, "Without free software, I'd have started years later. I'd have lost the opportunity to collaborate with people spread all over the entire world. My first job would've looked very different, as would my entire career since then." And he goes on to say, "Without free software, almost everything I've achieved in my adult life would've been impossible." So these are themes that basically came up over and over again as I started asking people. And so today I want to talk a little bit about what that looks like. How do you get to the point where, in 5 or 10 years, someone's asking you the same question? Like, "How has open source impacted your career?" And you can look back and say, "Everything that I've accomplished so far is because of my participation in this community." So I want to talk a little bit about the value of contributing to open source. So, what is it? Why does it matter? Why is it such an opportunity? I want to talk a little bit about becoming a contributor. I think for a lot of people, especially those that haven't worked in open-source communities before, it's a very intimidating thing to get started. So I want to propose what I hope is a really easy step for you to take to get started. And then last, I want to spend a little bit of time focusing on building your reputation, which is an important part of all of this.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>02:59.073</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So first, the value of contributing. Participating in open-source community-- well, first of all, has anyone participated in open source? Either raise your hand or comment in the chat if you made a comment on a open-source project, or made a pull request even. Very few people? That's awesome. So one of the cool things about participating in open source is it's used by companies all over the world. So if you look at, for example, Disney, John Deere, and Walmart. These are companies that you would think have nothing in common. We've got Disney who is both an animation company and a theme park. I don't really know what you call that industry. What is a company that makes theme parks? You've got John Deere. Most of us know them as a company that makes tractors. And Walmart who's the largest retailer in the world. These companies, on the surface, have essentially nothing in common except that they're all really well-known as being software companies and they're all really well-known for participating in open source. And they're not alone. Here's a bunch of other companies. All of these companies have GitHub accounts and have developers that are actively engaged in open source. And most of them, if you talk to some of their key leadership, would say that they identify more as a software company than they do as whatever industry they're in. So Disney might make theme parks, but what they really make is software that runs theme parks, and builds movies, and all of those things.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:35.288</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So we're at this stage where essentially every company is becoming a software company, and every software company uses open source. And so if you think about the way that-- again, it doesn't matter the industry. But whichever one of these companies is building software, usually what this looks like is they have their application, which I'm just calling this big box, and then there's a bunch of components that they build. So they're hiring thousands and thousands of developers to build these custom things. And these are the things that give them unique value. So for John Deere, they sell tractors, but what sets them apart from everyone else that sells tractors is that their tractors drive themselves. You map out your field and buy a really expensive tractor, and then it does all of the farming for you. And you're essentially reducing the cost as much as you can. So all these companies are building some of these unique components. But along the way, they're building these on top of open-source software. And these are everything from the low-level hardware that powers their systems to the operating systems like Linux, the programming languages like Swift, and Ruby, and Java, and even all the implementations of JavaScript. All of these languages are open source. These are things like application libraries, so like Node or Ruby on Rails, you name it. All of these components are open source.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>06:04.188</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So, basically, every company that's building software has this mix of a few closed-source components, mostly built on the foundation of open-source software. And so if you talk to some of these companies about the types of developers that they want to hire, a lot of them are looking to open source as a place to find developers. So Chris DiBona from Google says, "Open-source software is strategic to Google. And naturally, we hire a great number of open-source developers. Someone who demonstrates their ability by contributing to open-source projects shows that they're able to code in the real world in ways that other software developers cannot readily match. It's the ultimate referral," he basically says. There's a recent jobs report that came out earlier in 2016, and what they say is - excuse me - 87% of hiring managers say that it's actually hard to find open-source developers to hire. So they're trying to find people that will fit into these companies and struggling to do it. So, basically, the rest of this talk is my secret patented formula, that you can't share with anyone else, to help these companies find you. It's really not that much of a secret. I don't know if that wasn't obvious or not.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>07:19.277</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So any job, whether it's software or anything else, there's three things that will help you be noticed and find the right opportunities. So one is, learn the skills and gain experience using those skills. Second is creating public artifacts that demonstrate those skills. If you're going into education, they call this a CV or curriculum vitae. For some jobs, you'll be submitting an application. For others, it'll be a resume. Third, is to making connections with people that need those skills. So once you have learned something, proven that you know that thing, now it's just a matter of finding people that need that. And so my argument is that open source is actually a great way to do all of those things. You get to practice in the open with some of the best developers in the world. As you're refining your skills, you're building a reputation because you're doing all of this in public, and you're also getting connected with a bunch of open-source communities. Is that making sense so far? Does anyone have questions? Oops, I cannot see the chat messages on Zoom. So, Joe, if you just want to-- feel free to interrupt me if somebody asks on there.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>08:37.648</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Yes.

So that's part one. There's tons of opportunity by participating in open source. I think most people probably recognize that. So the second question is, how do we become a contributor then? How do you start to get involved? And this is, I think for a lot of people, an incredibly intimidating experience. And so I want to start by, if I can-- let's see if this-- can you see that?

Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life. Have fun. Save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is, everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>09:48.806</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Does anyone know who that was?

Yeah, it's Steve Jobs. I love that quote. I'm also kind of a sucker for really gushy inspirational things. But this, I think, is a really incredible insight from Steve Jobs. "Everything around us that we call life was made up by people that were no smarter than us." And he ends that by saying, "Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again." So I want to dive into that for a second. What the heck does that mean? There's this XKCD that actually perfectly illustrates this. Just look around you at the things on your desk, and think about the people that made those things. So the lamp with the switch in front of us. That switch probably was the result of nine hours of meetings amongst a bunch of people that were just trying to make the best lamp switch you could possibly imagine. Or my desk has this little bevel, and it makes me wonder, how many hours did somebody spend trying to figure out is that the perfect bevel or not? I think it's easy for us to forget that all of these things were made by somebody that was in the same position as us once. They grew up, maybe went to college, maybe didn't. At some point got really interested in something and said, "I either want to be a software developer. I want to be an electrical engineer." They spent a bunch of time learning about that thing and trying to get better at it. And then they went on, and at some point found a job doing it. I don't know why it just kind of blows my mind thinking about that. And open source is no different. In fact, I would argue that open source is even more that case. All of the software that we use.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>11:40.933</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So if anyone's ever used jQuery. Has anyone used jQuery? A couple of people. Yeah, we got some thumbs up. That was started by John Resig when, I think, he was like 12. Okay, maybe he wasn't 12. He was probably like 18. But point being, he was just a guy going through school, trying to build a website, and was like, "I'm going to start to reuse a bunch of this code that I made." And eventually this turns into this really popular open-source project. Same with Linux in the early '90s, when Linus Torvalds started Linux. He was just a grad student, and he invested a ton of time and energy into it. It's not that it wasn't a lot of work, but he was someone that was like, "Here's a problem. I want to solve it. I'm going to spend a bunch of time learning more about it and just get into it." So the point of this, I mean, people that make open source are basically just like you. Some of them are students or hobbyist. Some might work for start-ups. Some work for large companies. Some of them are really smart. Some of them are crazy technical and I don't understand what they do, and they make me feel like all I'm doing is building Legos all day. But I can take the things that they build and recombine them in other interesting ways and still create things that are valuable. And most of those people that are doing that are people just like you and me.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>13:01.016</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So that means, as you're getting started, you're going to be looking back at all these people that have years and years of accomplishment and you're going to be like, "Well, I could never contribute to something like jQuery or something like ReactJS," or you name it. What's your favorite open-source project of choice? It's important at this point to remember that that is the result of 5 or 10 years of work from a lot of those people, but at one point, they were new. And that's where you're at, possibly. So actually, it looks like most of you have already started contributing to open source, and so you're a few steps ahead. So you're going to likely struggle with this thing called imposter syndrome. If you haven't heard of it yet, get used to it because you'll hear of it a lot, and it'll be something that you feel a lot. I think everyone I know that works in software development feels this in some form. So it will be your friend; your sad, sad friend for a long time. Yeah. Just know that that feeling is natural and common, so.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>14:05.947</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">All right. Let's get into some actual technical advice here. So as people who are looking to get into open source, there's often three different flavors of advice. Some people will say, "Find a bug that you have the skills to fix." This has been a pretty common emerging pattern where you go to a site-- I'll show some examples later on. But there's a bunch of sites that will have bugs from projects that are kind of geared towards people getting into projects. So there's a site called First Timers Only or Up-for-Grabs. There's nothing wrong with that. I think that that's a really good approach to it, especially if this is your first time and you're just looking for something to sink your teeth into. The second flavor of advice is finding a project that is welcoming to newcomers. And, again, I think that this is generally a good approach, and there's a bunch of sites - I'll show you links to those later - that help you find a project that's geared for somebody like you to get involved in. And the third type is picking a project that you already use. And this is one that I want to spend, actually, a little bit more time on. I see there's some messages coming in on chat. Are those--<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>15:19.281</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">It's okay.

Cool, cool. Excellent. It's weird. The Zoom will show me that there's messages coming in but I can't actually see them. So if you're talking about me, I won't know [laughter]. So yeah, let's talk about contributing to a project that you already use. So there's nothing wrong with those other two approaches of finding either a random bug or a random project and just making a contribution. I think that those are really good ways to get started for the very first time. I think the challenge with those approaches is that you don't have any selfish motivation to stick to that because you don't want anything from those projects. If you're just finding a random project that you don't care about or don't need anything from, when it starts to get hard, which it inevitably will, it's really easy to-- it's like, "Oh, it's about dinnertime. I'll pick this up tomorrow." And then you don't. You walk away from it. And so what I like about getting involved in a project that you already use is that you have selfish motivations to stick to it. You want something from that project. You want it to be better. You want either a bug to be fixed or a feature to be added, and you're going to be reminded of that every time you use the project. And hopefully you use it a lot going forward.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>16:40.083</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">One second. So some of the typical advice for getting involved in a project-- I mean, the idea is you want to try and be-- you want to try and go from just being a user of the project to being a contributor. And I think what a lot of people kind of sell themselves short on is that they don't consider themselves a valuable contributor until they've made changes to code. And I want to try and debunk that a little bit. I think one of the most valuable things that you can do to become a contributor is actually to just become an active user of the project. And so think about some of the projects that you use today, and we'll take a minute here to make a list of those. But at this point, you've probably just-- maybe you've downloaded them. Let's use jQuery as an example. You downloaded it from GitHub or you just linked to it. There's places where you can link to it from the CDN. And then you use it on your project, on your web page. At this point, all you are is a passive user. But the first step to becoming a contributor is actually becoming an active and engaged user, and so you start to watch the project. You start to report bugs. You start to have conversations with other people that are users. And at some point, you're going to find yourself becoming slightly more and more engaged with this project, to the point where becoming a contributor doesn't feel like this big intimidating thing.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>18:11.732</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So let's take a minute. Think about the last project you worked on and think about what open-source projects it depended on. Our goal today is I want everybody to come away with a project that they can start thinking about becoming an active user of. So, for example, I was working on a project last week that was an NPM project and has a bunch of dependencies. So I typed NPM list. And there is this cool debugging library. It's called Debug. There's a testing framework called Expect. If the rest of the printout was there, there's a Node GitHub API client. There's a GitHub webhook library that helps you receive webhooks from GitHub. And so what I did, actually, while I was working on this project was I found the GitHub API client didn't have support for some of the new things that were rolled out in the last few weeks. And so I went to that project and just simply reported them. Okay, I created a new issue that said, "This feature is missing." And there was another one where a feature was broken.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>19:31.384</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Another example of this - if you're using Rails, you can do the same thing - bundle list. So, with that, does anyone have a project in mind or is everyone thinking of something at least? Okay. So, with that project, think about any friction that you ran into. Think about ways that you will want to use that again in the future. So once you have a project in mind, here's in my opinion, the most important step to becoming an open-source contributor, and that's going to the GitHub repository and clicking this button. Clicking the watch button. So let's do this right now. We're going to take a little break here, a little five-minute stretch break. And I just want it to appear to get out of keynote.<br />[silence]<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>20:39.281</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">All right.

All right. So I just went to Mike de Boer Node GitHub, which is the project I was referencing. And I went and clicked the watch, changed it from not watching to watching. And so the reason I think that this is such an important step is this now gives you, essentially, regular reminders that this is a project that you care about and that you can contribute to in some way. So now over the next few weeks, as other users report issues or the maintainer makes changes and opens pull requests, you can start to see some of the activity happening on this project. And maybe not at first. Maybe for the next couple weeks you'll have nothing to contribute. You'll see all these coming in, and you're like, "Oh yeah, I remember a few weeks ago I watched that repo. And I should probably do something." But at some point soon, there's going to be somebody that reports an issue that you had at one point. Or there's going to be somebody voicing their support for a feature that you wish that was there, and you can go in and say, "Hey, me too. I've had this problem," or, "Here's how I fixed this problem." Or if the maintainer starts asking for feedback from the people that use it, you can be one of the ones that starts to let your voice be heard. And that's all it takes. The easiest step to becoming a contributor is literally just watching projects that you use and seeing some of the activity coming through.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>22:54.750</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Let me give a more concrete example of this. Let's see if I can get back into keynote. There we go. You guys can see my screen? Cool. So there's a project called GitHub Linguist that I used to maintain, and a couple of other people at GitHub did. And a few years ago, this guy named Paul, Pchaigno-- I'm not actually sure how to pronounce his name. This guy named Paul shows up. We were doing a bunch of triage on the project of going through old issues and trying to figure out if things were still a problem or if this thing had been fixed since then. And Paul just started reporting errors, reporting issues that he had with it. So here he says, "I tried this thing-- yeah, I tried this thing on this other repo. Here's the things I tried, and it still has the same problem." A few weeks later-- well, over the next coming weeks and months, Paul starts to just basically, every once in a while, just chime in. And he gets to the point where other users would be opening issues and he would start responding to them. And so this person is reporting an issue with detecting Perl 6, and he said, "Hey, from what I understand, you have to do this. Is this the case?" And before we realized it, Paul was essentially one of the most active contributors on this project; where people would start reporting issues, he would investigate them. And then if you notice the second one, he replies to Luto, "@luto, highlighting for hbs files doesn't work, blah, blah, blah." It goes on. He says, "I'm going to open a PR to fix this." And then he comes back later and says, "Oh, actually, I did. It's number 1437."<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>24:36.233</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And this just keeps going on. So, I mean, let me go back here. One of the first activity-- I think he actually had some activity before June, but I screenshotted this one in June, 2014. Now we are here, May 25th of this year. We get to the point where people are opening new issues saying, "Hey, this thing is wrong," and Paul's the first one to respond, often linking to docs that are already written or other resources to help these users solve their challenge. And, by the way, he's also updating the docs a ton to help guide new users so the next person that comes along has a question won't be stuck. He's not employed at GitHub. I think he now works for some university in Paris. I'm not really sure exactly what his interest is in this project, but he's been engaged for two years as a volunteer working on this. And, actually, he's now a core committer and has committer access to do whatever he wants. But in my mind, this is one of the most ideal steps to becoming actively engaged in open source. It started with him just casually observing, he slowly starts to comment, and then over time, gets more and more engaged in the project.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>25:56.308</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So, I think, solving your own problems, so finding projects that you use, saying that they're not good enough - either they have bugs or somehow, I want them to be better - and finding ways to do that to make those improvements is one of the best ways to start to build skills and experience. I talked to people and asked some of the most well-known developers and best developers I knew, "What got you into this?" I'd hear things like this. So this guy says, "I got my first real web job because I learned some small open-source CMS that the agency happened to use." So he started to get invested in the CMS. Eventually, he learns Drupal, and he says, "I got my next big job due to Drupal experience." And it's these stories, over and over again, that I've heard that I think kind of reemphasizes how important it is of just slowly starting to get engaged with some of these tools that you use. And thinking about, who else in the industry uses these, and what other opportunities might those lead to?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>27:01.661</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">All right, last section here. So the previous one was just focused on getting engaged, and over time, you start to build a bunch of skills. I also think that in the midst of that, it's important to think about the ways that you are building a reputation. It doesn't matter how good a developer, or how good a designer, how good a writer, how good a public speaker you are. None of that stuff matters if there's no evidence publicly of it. So start to think about the ways the things you're doing can leave public artifacts. As you're learning and gaining experience, start to create a habit of leaving a trail of the things that you've learned. Ask yourself, whenever you're learning something new or getting involved in something, "How can I create an artifact from this work?" An example of this-- so this talk is probably not a great example, but it's applicable example here. This talk is part of some work I'm doing on thinking about the ways that people get involved in open source. How can GitHub help them? From this talk, I created this slide deck. I turned it into notes for some other people on our team. I presented this talk at a conference a few weeks ago, which there's a video of. I uploaded these slides to Speaker Deck so that there's evidence that the deck exists. And probably from this it will become, actually, a bigger project focused on helping people make that first step of watching a repository on GitHub. And so that's the kind of thing I'm thinking about.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>28:36.377</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">As you're working on projects, as you're learning new things, every step of the way I think about, "How can you turn this into some sort of public artifact that demonstrates that you've learned this thing or you've gained this experience?" Anybody know what this is? Yeah, so this is the GitHub contribution graph. This is one example of what I'm talking about. I mean, as you're getting involved, and starting to code, and working on GitHub, you'll start to leave this trail. This trail is one important part of it, but you also have to keep in mind that this is only one part of it. The contribution graph only shows changes to code. And as any of us know, that have worked on software projects in the past, code is only one small part of a successful software project. A coworker of mine, again as I was asking people about their experience in open source, talks about one of the biggest barriers for her was to put everything she did, as imperfect or broken as it was, up on GitHub. And this can be scary, I think, for some people, especially those of us that suffer from imposter syndrome. Say, "Okay. I don't know that I want to put this code up on GitHub because it's not good enough. Other people will think I'm not a good programmer." Whatever. But what you'll start to see is, over time, that practice of putting things out in the open forces you to actually refine your skills and make them better. And some of it's taking advantage of the imposter syndrome and saying, "Okay. I'm a little bit scared to share this, so I'm going to make it just a tiny bit better. I'm going to try and-- I'm going to spend 15 more minutes tweaking this thing to make it better so that I can share it publicly."<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>30:18.562</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">The other thing to remember in terms of open source is that it's more than code. If we look at-- this is a graph that was published on the GitHub blog earlier this year that looks at the total contributions to a project based on the number of contributors. So that the X-axis is the total contributor count to a project that's a logarithmic scale. First we have 10, then we have 100, and then have 1,000. And then the X-axis is basically the ratio of what activity is happening. And so when a project's first getting started, when there's only a few people involved, most of it is pushes or exchanges to code. Then as a project grows, we start to see the code becomes less and less the key part of a project. And the biggest thing you see growing are issues and issue comments. So just keep in mind, as you're looking at some of these open-source projects, by getting involved in code is one way, but there's a ton of other ways. You can do code and design on sort of the implementation side, but then-- I mean, as you're seeing going through the Campus Expert program, you have speaking, you have organizing events, you have community management and mentoring, recording issues and documentation. All of these are really, really valuable ways to contribute. And beyond that there's other public sites, again, that you can start to get involved in that help these projects be successful that aren't necessarily tied to GitHub or just the code around the project. So get involved in Stack Overflow. Now, if you're using an open-sourced project, search Stack Overflow for that tag and you'll start to see people that have questions. Subscribe to that tag, and you can start to be one of first people to help respond.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>32:08.384</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">I know a guy that works at Google right now, that all he does is he-- well, not all he does. I'm sure he does a bunch of other things. But one of the most important things he does is he watches Stack Overflow for questions that come up around one of his projects. And then he goes and he writes a blog post about them. And so he will, essentially, write his blog post as if he's asking the question, and then he will give a big detailed response. And what he started to see is that often people will quickly respond to the Stack Overflow questions with links to his blog post. Which, again, blogging is just another way of leaving a public trail. Another note on blogging. One of the things I tried to do earlier on in my career - I have been really bad about it lately - I started to use Friday mornings as my open source and blogging time. So every Friday, I would sit down and say, "Okay, what did I learn about this week?" or, "What did I work on this week that I can make public?" And sometimes it was really lame. Sometimes it was like, "Oh, I ran into this bug on this project, and I spent three hours debugging it." And I'm just going to do a two-paragraph blog post in hopes that some other person that runs into that issue doesn't have to spend two hours trying to figure it out. Sometimes the posts were actually really good. Sometimes there were things that ended up being really helpful or informational for somebody else that came along. But just try to start to build a habit or a pattern of sharing these things publicly, whether it's Stack Overflow blog or even Twitter. I mean, social media, as you probably well know already, is a great way to start to build a reputation for being involved and being an expert on something.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>33:50.373</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">I want to end this though by a word of warning. Just because you're active on Twitter doesn't actually mean that somebody will magically hire you for this thing. I think that there's an interesting balance to try and let your expertise be known and be helpful, but also being humble and being human. Which is kind of the last thing I want to end this section on is, your online persona is your resume. It's becoming that more and more, whether it's your GitHub profile, your responses to Stack Overflow, your Facebook activity. All of those things. As any employer is going to look at hiring you are going to be looking through your public record. So be careful. You want to try and be yourself. You don't have to be somebody you're not, but you also have to be authentic. And especially in time, like heated political times right now is a good example of, "I probably Tweeted some things in the last week or two that I shouldn't have." If you're following US politics, you know what I'm talking about. But just be careful. Try and show as much of yourself as you can online, but also keep in mind that these will become part of your permanent record and any employer will be looking at that.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>35:18.458</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">All right. So I'm just going to wrap up. I think contributing to open source, it's not going to bring you fame or riches. I hope I don't leave you that impression. But it will help you build experience, hopefully open up a lot of opportunities, and it's a ton of fun. Last quote, going back to my little mushy inspirational soft spot in my heart, your job is to build a cage that can catch luck as it flies by. And I think that's a good way to think about all of this. The next talk you give, the next event you organize, the next project you work on, none of those individually are going to be the things that, all of a sudden, bring you opportunity. But all of those things, I think, are pieces of this cage that you're building that will help open up the next opportunity.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>36:10.000</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">That is it. Well, a quick shout-out for mentorships. I know you're all already involved in Campus Experts, so this is maybe less applicable to you. But we're starting to pull together some resources around mentorships in open source. If that's something you think you might be interested in, there's a bunch of programs where you can actually get paid to work on open source for the summer, either through GitHub or through other organizations. That's all I got.</p></blockquote></div>
