This README explains how to get started with the training, and how to become a Campus Expert. By participating in the Campus Expert program, you agree to the [terms](https://education.github.com/experts/terms).

## What is a Campus Expert?

People learn better when they can learn with a community of likeminded peers. A Campus Expert is a student trained to build a strong technical community, on campus. As well as training, Campus Experts have access to resources and support from GitHub, such as swag, sponsorship, and the opportunity to attend events like GitHub Universe.

## How do I become a Campus Expert?

To become a Campus Expert, you must complete the following:

- Module 0 - Getting Started.
- Module 1 - Introduction.
- At least 3 other modules.

Please bear in mind the following requirements:

- Campus Experts must be 18 years of age and over.
- You must not be within 3 months of finishing your course of study.
- There is a limit to the number of Campus Experts per university. This limit is dependent on several factors. If in doubt, please check through one of the support channels listed below.

Once you have completed the necessary modules, and if you are within the requirements, you can complete the application module. Once complete, we will review your application as soon as possible.

## What is a training module?

Training modules help you learn skills that are important towards building technical communities. A training module contains a video tutorial, as well as assignments you must complete to progress in the module.

## How do I choose which modules to complete?

Every Campus Expert should start with the Introduction module. During this module, you will gain a much better understanding of your community, and what you need to learn in order to make your community shine. Completing the Introduction module will guide your further module choices.

## What benefits do Campus Experts get from GitHub?

When you complete the training and become a Campus Expert, you have access to benefits and extra support from GitHub.

Campus Expert benefits depend on the training modules completed. Each training module awards access to a different set of related benefits, described in the README of the training module. As a Campus Expert completes more training modules, they will gain access to more resources to use to help their community. Benefits range from free stickers and cheat sheets for your school, to event/hackathon sponsorships, to travel support to attend GitHub events and conferences.

In addition to material resources and benefits, Campus Experts gain access to regular webinars and guest talks from industry experts, and spaces to collaborate with other Campus Experts and GitHubbers.

A full list of benefits currently available can be found [here](docs/benefits).

## How does being a Campus Expert work? What are the expectations of a Campus Expert?

During the Introduction module, you will define and set goals for your community. As a Campus Expert, you are expected to meet these goals, and build the best community for your campus. We at GitHub understand that you are busy students, trying to make your campus a better place. This is why you set your own community goals, and participate in as much of the training as you need to to achieve those goals.

When you become a Campus Expert, you gain access to tools that help you make resource requests, and collaborate with GitHub Staff and other Campus Experts.

## Do I need to know how to use Git/GitHub?

Campus Experts is about _your community_, not becoming a Git master. However, Campus Experts and the training does primarily take place through GitHub, so some Git/GitHub knowledge is helpful. You can learn everything you need to complete the training [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/). 

## How do I get help whilst following the training?

You can find detailed support instructions [here](.github/SUPPORT.md).
