I absolutely love what Joe and the rest of GitHub are doing with Campus Experts, and great to see you're all involved with that. I think it's super, super awesome that you're all involved. And happy to be here to help out and try and give some advice. So I'll just introduce myself. I'm Tim. I'm the commissioner at Major League Hacking. Major League Hacking, if you don't know it, is the student hackathon league. So we help support over 250 hackathons across Canada, US, Mexico, and Europe every academic year, and we have about 65,000 students come to those events every year, which is super, super awesome. And I absolutely love hackathons. I think they're a fantastic opportunity to learn new things and meet cool new people. And my day-to-day job at Major League Hacking is helping hackathon organizers run awesome events and giving them advice and support that they need to be successful. So today, we're going to talk about money, and we're going to be covering a couple of things. We're going to start off talking a little bit about how to actually generate a budget and know what you need your money for. Then we're going to talk about how do you get that money through sponsors, understanding what sponsors are looking for. And we're going to look a little bit about laying the groundwork for before you go out and speak to sponsors and try and raise sponsorship, what a sponsorship process looks like, and what you should actually kind of be doing in order to successfully reach out to and close sponsors. And then at the end, we're going to look at a few pro tips and some things to watch out for. So first off, let's talk a little about making a budget. The first question that you have to ask yourself is do you actually need any money? And this is a really important question to ask because you don't want to fall into the trap of thinking that you need something when really, you don't. I speak to a lot of hackathon organizers on a daily basis, and I so often hear things from them like, "Oh, hey. We need to get T-shirts and we need to get stickers." But that's kind of missing the point of why you're getting involved in organizing tech events and organizing a tech community. You don't need those things. What you need is you need something educational and fun for people to get involved with, and T-shirts and stickers are not necessary for that. And you're going to be sinking a lot of money into things which might not be necessary.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>02:31.629</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And the same goes for things like food or travel reimbursements. You don't need to have food at an event for it to be really, really great. You can choose to do any type of event you want to. You could do an hour-long workshop, and you could run that weekly. And if you're doing hour-long workshops, you definitely don't need food. That's definitely not something that's necessary. It might be nice to try and get people in, but you don't need to do that, and there's plenty of successful events which don't need food or travel reimbursements or anything like that. Even when it comes to hackathons, there are examples of hack days. There's John Stevenson in London who runs Hack the Tower every month, and all he does for that is just goes and buys £30 worth of sandwiches for people. And if you communicate with people and let them know that, "Hey. That's what's going to happen, and there isn't going to be any food at the event," then people will still come because they're interested in the tech, they're interested in the community, and they're interested in the fun. So it's important to understand that you really might not need any money. And you should really think very critically about why you think you need money. You might definitely need money for hosting if you want to set up a website, but even then, you can use GitHub Pages or a Facebook group, and it'll be totally cool, too. So just really think very critically about that. And it might turn out that like, "Hey. Yes, we do want to have money, and we do want to kind of get something special for some events," but at most universities, they'll have a series of events which don't need any money or funding at all, and then maybe they'll have one or two events which needs a little bit more funding because they want to do something a little bit special. But just have a think about that.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:20.473</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">When you do you sit down to think about what you'll actually need money for, make sure to create an itemized list of costs and really go through every single thing that you need to buy and think about that and keep adding to that. So many times, I see budgets which are incomplete and don't really have everything on them, and that completely defeats the purpose of a budget because you need to know exactly how much money you need. Second of all, make several versions of a budget because you might want to think about, "Okay. What's the minimum amount of money that we need to run this event?" And then, "What's our stretch goal? If we had all the money in the world, what would we want to buy?" So for example, if you were doing a 24-hour hackathon, in your kind of baseline budget, you might have food and that's pretty much it, and then in your stretch goal, maybe you'll add T-shirts into your stretch goal, or stickers, or things which really aren't necessary into your stretch goal. Also, you want it based on different variables, so make it dynamic and say, "Well, if we had 100 people attend, how much money would we need? If we only had 20 people attend, how much money would we need?" We want to be able to change that and take a look at how the budget would change depending on certain variables. So you should keep in mind that a budget is a dynamic document that should be updated and tested all the time throughout organizing whatever event or thing [inaudible]. Next up, it's good to start out with kind of guesses and estimates for how much everything will cost, but in the end of the day, you need to get actual quotes for your costs because it's completely pointless having a budget that there's only a guess, because you need to know exactly how much money you need to spend. And to know how much money you need to spend, you need to go out and speak to vendors, speak to people who are selling food, or T-shirts, or stickers, or whatever you need to get, and get the actual quotes.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>06:18.030</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Next up, it's really important to keep it readable for your entire organizing team. So that means you should be making notes next to all of your line items to tell people where you got that quote from and what that quote includes, and also making sure that you share it with the rest of your team. So using something like Google Drive, or Dropbox, or other things so you're able to share the budget is really, really important. And finally, just make sure to keep it up-to-date. A budget is not something that you make at the start of planning an event or planning a year's worth of a society and then never look at again and never update again. It's something you should be looking at on a regular basis and updating depending on what the actual costs are. So let's start with the basics of understanding sponsors and looking at why sponsors get involved with events. So why do companies sponsor? Well, the first thing to understand is, fundamentally, this is business. People are not going to sponsor your events out of the kindness of their hearts. And even when they are doing it for a philanthropic reason, they still are going to have metrics and things that they need to show to their bosses. So it's really important to understand that you need to provide something to sponsors because this is a business relationship. And likewise, you should keep in mind that because it's a business relationship, and you're getting into a business relationship with somebody, you will need to treat it like a business relationship, and be professional with them, and keep that in mind. So generally, there are four reasons that a company will sponsor an event. There's developer evangelism. There's marketing. There's recruitments and philanthropy. And it's really important that you target each of these companies appropriately. So if you're talking to a developer evangelist, you don't want to email them a bunch of stuff about how good the recruiting at your society is going to be because they don't care, and it's just going to be annoying for them.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>08:25.676</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So if we take a look at developer evangelism, the objective of a developer evangelist is to get developers excited about their platform and to gather feedback and use cases for their platform. So valuable kind of perks for a developer evangelist is providing them with workshops or demos that they can do, giving you an opportunity to distribute coupon codes for their platform and actual in-person interactions, where they get to talk with students and developers about their product and understand what kind of things they're interested in. So examples of companies which are really interested in developer evangelists are API companies, like Twilio or SendGrid. Next type kind of reason that a sponsor would sponsor an event is marketing. And their objective there is to kind of raise brand awareness or change perception of their brands. So valuable things that you can offer them are experiences, like maybe some sort of mini-event at a hackathon. Maybe bring them in to do a dinner or something at your university. Having branding position is really important for them. So getting them on your website and on maybe your T-shirts and hoodies or something would be great, and also kind of the opportunity to share kind of positive interactions. So you would go out and tell people like, "Oh, hey. So in such and such a company really helped us out," etc. So examples of companies which might want to do marketing would be maybe drinks companies like Red Bull would want to market to students. So you notice that maybe they might not necessarily be tech companies. They might be food or drink companies, or something else which provides a product to students. But it might also be tech companies, or it might be companies who are interested in kind of improving their view among students to help with recruitment. So examples might be Capital One, or Bloomberg, or Microsoft.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>10:44.310</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then we come to recruitment, and recruitment is somewhere where there is often a lot, a lot of money. So this can be easily a very, very large portion of where your sponsored money might come from. And their objective there is simply to recruit the top technical talents and also to kind of improve their branding as a cool employer. So valuable things you could offer them is resumes. Of course, if you do that, you would want to kind of do that in a way which people feel good with. So getting people to opt-in is far more valuable, both for the recruiters and for the students, and the opportunity to do some thought leadership. That means maybe coming in and giving a speech about the type of technology that they're working on. And thirdly, of course, interactions. So coming in and actually meeting people and getting involved with people. So examples of big recruiters, I mean, they're all over the place, whether it's banks, consultancies, or [inaudible] tech companies, start-ups. Everybody is recruiting these days. And finally, some companies might get involved with philanthropy. And their objective there is to give back to the community. But you also have to keep in mind that it's something that they want to do kind of out of the goodness of their heart, but they're likely to also have some sort of metrics that they want to be able to show that, "Yes. We are doing good," and be able to measure how much good they're doing. Kind of companies are like that. So they also kind of want to improve their branding and maybe their recruitment pipeline as well. So if you're able to offer them some case studies, thought leadership, again, that are able to come and talk about what kind of things they do and branding position might be important to them as well. Yeah. And some examples of companies who do some good philanthropic work are, again, all the big ones like Facebook, Microsoft, and GitHub recently put out a really cool page about all the great philanthropic work that they're doing. Maybe Joe will be able to send out a link about that or something. It's really quite awesome.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>12:57.732</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So how do companies actually decide who to sponsor? Well, there are several different kind of ways that a sponsor might evaluate who they want to kind of get involved with. So they want to look at how much money does it cost for them to get an impression or get in touch with kind of a person they're interested in. They want to look at, "Are the people I'm getting in touch with, the attendees of events, are they valuable to me?" And they want to look at who else is sponsoring. And they want to look at, "What I'm actually getting from the event or from the society, is that actually valuable to me, or is it something not very valuable? Maybe it's just a tiny logo on the sleeve which I'm not really that interested in." And then finally, they'll just kind of go with their gut and see, "Is this roughly what I'm interested in?" So when it comes to cost per attendee, and this can be the people who are coming to your events or the people who are registered in your society, but essentially, this is the sponsor looking at their bang for their buck. They kind of want to try and minimize the ratio of the amount of money they're paying versus the number of people that they're reaching. So let's take a quick look at maybe some events as examples. So if you take a look at Dreamforce, which is a conference by Salesforce-- Salesforce makes sales software, and they do a bunch of other things as well. But they have this conference which hundreds of thousands of people attend. I think from a couple years ago, it was about 135,000 attendees, and their cost per sponsorship tier, their top tier is like $1.5 million to sponsor this event. And that comes out to roughly $10 as a cost per attendee. And then down at the very bottom, you're looking at kind of cents per attendee, but you're kind of getting less exposure.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>15:00.349</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So that's a really, really big conference where you get tons and tons of people from all different backgrounds coming. You go for something which is a little bit more targeted, like PyCon, where they have only a couple thousand attendees, and their top tier might be around $50,000. Their cost per attendee is a lot higher, so it's like $25 per attendee. And the reason that sponsors are willing to pay that is because it's a more targeted audience. So you can be sure that you're going to be getting in touch with some really, really good PyCon developers if you're sponsoring PyCon. So if that's what you're interested in, you're going to pay a premium to get a targeted audience. And likewise, if you look at kind of a random hackathon, which may be 200 attendees, their top tier might be something around $10,000, depending on where you are in the world. And the cost per attendee there is even higher still, and again, it comes down to paying a premium for a focused audience. And if a company is interested in recruiting from a particular university or interested in recruiting students in general with a tech background, then they're going to pay a premium to want to get involved with their targeted audience. So you want to look at the cost per-- they want to minimize their cost per attendee, but they're willing to pay more if there's a more focused audience. So the thing there is they want to look at kind of how valuable is each attendee. They want to look at the fit, so are they potential customers or do we want to recruit them? How difficult is it to get in touch with them in general? So how hard is it to maybe get in touch with students at this university? Maybe there are dozens and dozens of events that they already sponsor, so it's not that difficult to get in touch. Maybe you are the only tech society on campus, so they have to go through you, and then they're going to be willing to pay a premium again. And then their potential. Are these people going to eventually become high-income people who might want to buy their products? Are they going to be good people to hire two years down the line to get into [inaudible] now?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>17:14.208</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Thirdly, they're going to look at sponsor landscape. So they're going to look at kind of how many sponsors there are, how good are the other sponsors, and how much value are they getting from getting involved with this sponsor landscape. So the question here is which kind of website is more valuable for a sponsor to be on? One where they're surrounded by hundreds of other sponsors or one where there are just a couple of good brands there with them? It might depend on what people are looking for, but you should realize that sponsors are willing to pay for exclusivity, and if you kind of limit the number of sponsors to 3, 4, 5, 10, etc., limiting the number of sponsors means that you can charge a premium for being involved kind of in a large way. Yeah. Next up, they also, of course, look at the actual value of the package that you're selling them. They're going to say, "Hey. I might be getting in touch with such and such many people, but am I actually getting my money's worth for getting in touch with those people? Am I going to have some good interactions? Am I only going to have a tiny logo on the sleeve, or am I going to actually go there in person and speak to these people and really get good interactions with them?" So direct contributions to attendee's experiences, for example, GitHub bought me this meal, have been shown to be more effective as a sponsorship mechanism than just having their logo on their website. So linking sponsors to specific things that attendees are getting is a really great way of giving sponsors their money's worth. And finally, the last thing, honestly, that people look into is just their guts and like, "Does this feel like something that I should be sponsoring?" And that just comes down to feeling.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>19:18.298</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So let's take a quick look at how companies actually pay for sponsorships because it's important to understand this whilst you're talking to sponsors. The first thing you have to understand is that usually, the people who are handling the sponsorship and the people who are handling the budget are different people. So the person you're talking to, to try and convince, "Hey. You should sponsor our event," is not the person who can decide how much to spend on things. That is governed usually by their boss or their boss's boss. So an important kind of consequence of that is that when you're talking to somebody at a company and you're trying to get them to sponsor, you need to bear in mind that you need to convince them, but you might also need to convince the rest of their team or their boss. So once you convince them, you want to be able to give them the resources necessary to go back to their team and say, "Hey. This is a really good opportunity for us." And likewise, if you want to kind of develop a long-term relationship, you want to be able to give them the feedback and show them, "Hey. This year, you managed to do X, Y, and Z, and it was really, really effective," so they can go back to their team and say, "We should definitely do this again next year." It's also really important to understand that businesses operate on quarterly budgets. So that means they split up the year into three-month periods. And they will generate a budget for the year, but they will also generate budgets for each single quarter. So every new quarter, a team will get a new quarterly budget, and then they'll start to know roughly what they'll be able to spend in each quarter. So two of the best times to get money is at the start of Q1 because it's the start of the year, start of the new quarter, and they have a bunch of new money that they can play with. And they can be like, "Oh, great. We want to be able to throw money here, here, here." And they have money, and they want to use it. But it's also really great to get in touch at the end of a quarter or at the end of Q4 because one of the strange things about business is that if you don't spend all of the money in your budget, you're going to get a smaller budget next year. So you need to be able to spend everything in your budget.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>21:43.924</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So you get this weird phenomena at the end of Q4, where companies are just trying to dump money as quickly as they can into wherever they can. So that's a great time to talk to people because they might have some leftover money. They might not. They might have already spent everything, but if they have any leftover money, they want to get rid of that as quickly as possible so that they can justify having a larger budget starting in Q1. So that's a really useful thing to know that it's kind of seasonal. It goes by quarters, and you should remind yourself that different businesses and different companies have different quarters. So depending on what country you're in, companies might work on a different quarterly season. And also, companies, in general, can choose to run on any quarters they want. So you get some companies who just run on completely different quarters. Maybe because their parent company is in the US, or their parent company is in another country, or they just choose to do it for some reason. And it is totally fine for you to ask somebody who you're talking to about sponsorship as like, "Oh, hey. When is your new quarter coming? When does your quarter end? When are you going to have your next quarter's budget?" Because if they come to you and they say, "Hey. We don't have any money right now for your society or for your events," you can say, "Oh, okay. Well, when will you know about your next quarter?" Then you will have a date, and you will be able to get in touch with them when they get then next quarterly budget.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>23:20.778</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Another thing to bear in mind is that recruiting budgets are highly, highly seasonal. So if a company is recruiting for a summer internship, then they are going to be spending the most of the money on marketing for that internship during the autumn of the previous year. So around this time is when they'll be kind of finishing up spending all of their money for recruiting for the summer internship. So starting kind of 2017, recruiters aren't going to be putting that much money into internship programs, but they will have been dumping money this semester because of the way that recruiting works seasonally. And the final thing that's really, really important to understand is that companies work on billing cycles, and billing cycles take time. So as soon as you close your sponsor and they say, "Yes. We really want to sponsor. Send us an invoice," then you're going to send them an invoice, and usually you will send them a net 30 invoice, which means that you ask them to pay the amount in 30 days. So that should be a clue for you that you're not going to get the money straight away. It's going to take 30 days. Even then, you might have to go-- if it's a large company, you might have to go through a process where they have to fill out something called a purchase order, and then you invoice them using the purchase order. And that can take weeks and weeks to actually get started, and then when you actually finally invoice them, again, it's an extra 30 days that it might take. So it could take a long time for the money to actually come through. And it's really important to understand that because you might need a cash flow. So you want to be keeping track of your budget and how much money is coming in, but you also need to make sure to keep track of your actual cash flow. When will I actually be getting the money? And again, this is totally fine to talk to your sponsors about. Ask them, "How does the invoicing system work? When am I likely to get the money? Do you know because we need to know for cash flow reasons." Totally cool to ask that. But keep in mind that you might need to get cash flow, and one thing you can do is maybe talk to your university or talk to you student's union, and they maybe might be able to help out with cash flow. So bear that in mind.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>25:43.425</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Next up, let's look at what kinds of sponsors are there. So there are several different ways that companies could sponsor your event. First of all, financially, just giving you money. They could be a presenting sponsor. Then you have anchor brands, strategic partners, and in-kind sponsors. So financial sponsors are companies that simply give you money and they get something back. And you're going to need a lot of these because this is where you are able to get your money. And almost every company on, say, a hackathon website is this kind of sponsor, where they will give you money to get workshops, prizes, etc. The next kind of sponsor you might have is a co-host or presenting partner, and they might co-brand the event with you. So for example, Localhost is coming up this weekend, and GitHub is a presenting partner for Localhost. So GitHub's logo is on the-- sorry, not Localhost. Local Hack Day. I'm getting confused. Local Hack Day is coming up this weekend, and GitHub is a presenting partner with Local Hack Day. So GitHub's logo is on the Local Hack Day logo, and we're working really closely with GitHub to figure out what kinds of things we want to do together and kind of working on the event together. So they will usually-- presenting partners might give you money to help run the events, and they'll be involved and integrated in a really strong way. One thing to bear in mind is that you don't want to give up too much control to a presenting partner. So generally, you don't want more than 50% of your budget to come from a presenting partner because if they drop out, then it could be a really, really bad situation for you. But also, you don't want to give up too much kind of creative control because they might start asking you to do things that you're not comfortable with. We've had lots of horror-- heard lots of horror stories in the past of companies which will start to say, "Oh, you need to do this. You need to do that." And kind of changing the goals of the event away from what the organizer originally thought. And then, in the end of the day, you end up organizing something that you didn't really want to organize, which can be really, really not great. But if you find a really, really kind of cool company who really gets what you want to do, and they're happy to give you control over organizers, then, cool. Then that can be a really great thing to get-- a really, really great thing to get.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>28:30.013</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Third thing that you-- third type of sponsor you might have is an anchor brand. This is a company that other similar brands will look for while sponsoring events. So for example, if I'm a sponsor and I'm looking at an event page, and I see that Twilio and Microsoft are sponsoring an event, then I'll be like, "Oh, well I trust that Twilio and Microsoft will be involved with good events, so I'm a little bit more confident that I can get involved too." So going out and reaching out to these brands and getting one sponsoring your website to start off with, which is an impressive brand, is a great anchor that will entice other brands to get involved as well. Yeah. And kind of a great example of that is there's a GitHub grant for new members of the Major League Hacking season, where GitHub will give $1,000 grants to new events in the [inaudible] season. And you'll be able to put GitHub's logo on your website and use them as an anchor brand because people look at GitHub and they say, "Oh, wow. If they're sponsoring them, I should get involved, too." Then you can have strategic partners. So they're kind of companies which might help with marketing or distribution in some way. So maybe that's a media company, or they could be a local news company, or it could be a company who will help with promoting to their audience or something like that. Maybe they'll put you on their blog, something like that. So they might not help out financially, but they might help out with marketing or in some other way. Or you might be able to kind of invite a speaker from a certain company. So maybe you could invite somebody famous, or a CEO, or a CTO from a cool company, and they might come and speak, and you'll be able to put their logo on the website. And that, again, will help with kind of prestige and looking like a cool event. Cool.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>30:33.428</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then finally, you have in-kind sponsorships, and these are companies who might donate goods or services instead of actual cash. So Redbull, for example, gives out a lot of free drinks to university societies and events. We had a really cool hackathon where BMW literally brought in a motorbike for people to play with, which was really cool. And then there are companies who might give you a discount. Particularly if you're a student, you might be able to get discounts from companies to things like stickers or hosting and stuff like that. Cool. So a question here is well, we've talked a little bit about how to get companies involved, but how do you actually get your university to help? Because if you're working at a university, then oftentimes, they have a lot of structure in place, and they can provide a lot of help and support for things. So let's take a look at kind of different types of sponsors that you might have within a university because a university is a very large place, and there are lots of different people and departments who might want to get involved. So different universities sponsors you might have, first of all, departments. So your computer science department might be really keen at getting involved in some of your tech events or a tech society, but bear in mind that it's not just computer science departments who might want to get involved. We've seen medical technology hackathons or medical technology societies where they get the school of medicine involved, too. Or you could maybe get the art school involved if you want to kind of have a collaboration on certain things. And getting other departments is a great way to get more people involved and learning about tech, and the other departments might be really keen to help support either financially, or by providing venues, or in some other way. So don't just limit yourself to CS, and don't even just limit yourself to STEM subjects. Go and reach out to other departments and think about different ways you could get involved with other departments.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>32:44.658</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Also, take a look into if there are any university grants available. Oftentimes, there will be some grants for initiatives that students start, so take a look and make a notification for those. If you have a student union at your university, then they would be really, really keen, I'm sure, to get involved with any kind of society or event. So go and speak to them and see if they would be interested in getting involved. Again, they might have a venue to help you out with, they might have money to help out with, and connections as well. So they might be able to speak to certain people, so that can help you out. Finally, you might have a career service, kind of on campus, and they're there to help kind of the employability of students and to help find them jobs. And they will be in touch with a lot of companies who are interested in recruiting at the university, which is brilliant because for your event and to sponsor at your.</p></blockquote></div>

Which is fantastic because that means that they have a list of companies who are interested in recruiting at your university. And companies who are interested in recruiting at university are probably interested in sponsoring your society or your events. So you can go and speak to them and ask them for their support, and ask them to maybe introduce you to sponsors who might be interested in these kinds of activities. And then finally, some universities have an accelerator where their aim is to kind of improve entrepreneurship and they would love to get technologically-minded people involved with that, and kind of market that they have this accelerator [inaudible] want to. So that is another opportunity for maybe-- they might be able to provide you space, some resources of some sort, and again they might have contacts with companies who might want to get involved. So there's lots of different people at universities who you can reach out to.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>01:15.084</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So you have all of those kinds of departments in universities, why do they want a sponsor? Well, again although the university is not a company, you have to remember that this is still business. People are still doing their jobs and they will have to kind of report to their bosses about what they've been doing, what they've been spending money on. And again it's a professional relationship and you have to provide them things professionally. So the reasons that people will want to sponsor, I think first and foremost universities are very, very interested in employability. They want to be able to market themselves as, "Hey we have really talented students for companies to hire, and if you come to your university then you're going to be able to get a job at the end of it." So being able to kind of convince people that, "Hey, these [inaudible] technology and getting-- improving the technology community on campus is going to improve the employability of students," is an easy thing to argue and university departments and the other kind of stakeholders at the university are going to be very, very excited about that. The second thing is the general university branding and the department branding, so getting people to think that, "Hey, this is a cool university to go to. Hey, this university has a lot of activities going on." And maybe if you're doing some sort of outreach to the local community, that would be really, really great for the university as well, they might be interested in that too. And also it's an opportunity maybe for them to kind of speak to students about, "Hey we have master's opportunities, or PhD opportunities," and again, they want to recruit as well, in some respects, for different programs. So it's an opportunity for them to do that.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>03:12.081</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then finally, philanthropy. So universities in particular oftentimes want to kind of show that they're helping the local community in some way. So if you're doing some sort of event that maybe gets involved in the local community, maybe it's something like teaching coding to school children in some way, then the university and the departments of the university might be really, really happy that you're doing that. And that's like the cherry on top to kind of say, "Hey we're also doing-- we're also helping out school children of the local community in some way," and that can be very, very helpful.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>03:54.014</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So let's get into, now that we know kind of where we want to get the money from, and we know what we want, what we're wanting to spend the money on, how do we actually go about getting the money? So sponsors are a lot like investors, and you want to approach them when you're doing well. That means that you want to actually have some progress towards your event or society, or you could always [inaudible]. So many times--<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:26.485</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">[crosstalk] write down Tim's name at the end--<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:28.156</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">[inaudible] you need to [meet?] yourself.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:33.372</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Sorry.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:35.851</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">It's fine [laughter]. So many times, people think that going and seeing the sponsors is their first step, but that's not true at all. You want to make some progress and then go see the sponsors. Before you go and see the sponsors, you should definitely have a clear vision for what you want to achieve, and it definitely helps if you have some sort of website, because people just tend to take you more seriously if you have a website. Which is funny, because it's so easy to set up a website, but it's true. People do take that seriously. And then finally, you want to have a little bit of traction, so you want to be able to show, "Hey, we've already got 25 students signed up for this society." Or, "We've had 25 students pre-register for this event," or, "We have such and such many people on our Facebook page," or something like that. Just showing that like, hey there is some interest here, and we are actually doing this thing, and it's a real thing.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>05:37.842</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Then, there's a couple of things which might not be locked down, like maybe the venue, or having other sponsors. But having those things, or having at least progress on those things, is helpful to show to other sponsors and say, "Yes, we're moving forward, and this is actually going to happen." Because if I'm a sponsor, and if somebody gets in touch with me, or sends me an email, and, it's not really clear what they are doing, they don't have a website, they don't have any venue or any people in their society, or something like that, then I'm going to say, "Hey you need to actually start working on these things and then come back to me when I know you're actually going to have them." So next step is you want to make sure that you actually know where the money goes. It's a good thing that you already have your budget sorted and you know exactly what you're spending your money on. So just remind yourself you need to double check your budget, and know exactly where the money goes, and then you can design a sponsorship prospectus.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>06:48.669</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And there are several types of kind of prospectuses that you might send out to sponsors, to show them the opportunities of getting involved with your society or your event. There's maybe a standard tiers document, you might do a catalog or PowerPoint deck, another might be custom proposals. And you can choose to use any one of these, whichever ones make sense for you. With the standard tiers document, it's usually one or two pages long, and it just provides a brief overview of what the event or society is doing and the sponsorship tiers for working with that event or society. So this is a really quick and easy one for people that are able to get the information they need and make quick decisions.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>07:35.163</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Next you might want to have a PowerPoint deck, which is usually a bit longer and it might go into more detail. This is maybe good if say, a company isn't really involved with hackathons that much, or isn't involved with tech societies, and they don't really understand exactly what's going on, it can give them a little bit more background on exactly what you are planning on doing and what your aims are. And that again, that's good for people who don't really know that much about what you're up to. And then finally you can have a custom proposal where you go into more detail about tailoring the sponsorship tier specifically for the sponsor that you're talking to. And again it will provide an overview of the event and outlines the custom package and the price of the custom package. And again it's important to send these kinds of things over because the person who is deciding, you need to convince them, but they also need to take these materials and send them back to their team and send them back to their boss, and convince them that, hey, this is something that is worth spending our money on, because they need to be able to get the money for you. Custom proposals are great if you're working with low volume sponsors, like 10 sponsors, then you should be creating a customer proposal for every single sponsor because it feels nice and it's very easy to do, and it makes sure that people feel good working with you.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>09:06.292</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So then a question is what should I be making my tiers? How much should I be charging for each different tier? Well imagine if your overall budget is 20,000 euro. Then these might be some example tier sizes, and the idea here is you have a progression from maybe 10% to 20% to 50%, so that should be roughly what you're thinking of for your tier sizes. When we think about it in that terms, then you're able to know exactly how many sponsors you're going to need to reach your budget. So I could have one top tier sponsor and maybe five of the bottom tier sponsors, or I could have one top tier sponsor, two middle tier sponsors and one bottom tier sponsor, and be able to reach my budget. And you're able to know exactly what you need to sell, and you're going to have a certain number of sponsors.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>10:14.528</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Cool, and when it comes to generating your sponsor tiers, and the packages that people are able to buy from you, if there are some good sponsor perks that you might include in that. So for example, if you're at a hackathon, then you might offer to have somebody to be able to give a prize or challenge. You might want to kind of offer people some sort of recruiting access. Again, it's really great to get students to actually opt into that, because that's targeted again, so it's actually more valuable if the students are opting in. And then students don't get kind of unsolicited emails from recruiters they're not interested in. And things like workshops, coming in to give a speech, or running a workshop for you, or maybe giving a dinner, or buying drinks for the society or something like that, are also some really nice things that you could do. And of course there's branding and other things around that as well.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>11:17.595</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Of course, there are some things that will always need to include in your sponsorship prospectus. So you want to make sure that it's clear what the name of your event or society is, and when any events are happening. If you're doing an event, you want to have the actual date there. So often people forget that, and that is some vital piece of information. Same with location, vital piece of information, because so often the first thing that sponsors are going to look at is like, "Oh, somebody sent me a sponsorship prospectus. Am I actually going to be able to make this event? Do we have the resources? Is somebody available on that day, and am I able to travel there?" And if not, then you're wasting your time and then you want them to just come out and say, "Sorry we're not able to do it." And if so, then they're able to actually say, "Oh yes I can do those. Let me read more and let me find out more about this event." So you definitely want to make sure you're including all this information, including things like projected attendance, how many people are in your society, how many people are you planning on having at a certain event, your website URL, and your contact details. And you need to make sure that you have these front and center. Should be front page, have all this information so that people can very quickly see what they need to do.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>12:37.269</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So let's talk a little bit more about sponsorship tiers because this is something that people oftentimes have a little bit of confusion about. They're a little bit worried they're not doing it quite right. So people often ask, "How many tiers should I have? How much should they be? What kind of perks should I have [inaudible] here?" When it comes to how many tiers you should have, in general you just want to have three tiers. We're going to have one very cheap tier, one in the middle tier, and one very expensive tier. And the reason for this, it's anchor pricing. So, people are more likely to go for the middle tier because they don't want to be cheap and get the lowest thing and they don't want to overspend and get the highest thing. So people are more likely to go for the middle tier, which is just fine. And you should keep that in mind that that's what you're looking at. So generally you want to have three tiers and some people might--<br />[silence]<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>13:36.683</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">[mind?]. So three tiers, sometimes maybe you add a fourth and have that be the presenting partner. Sometimes the top one of the-- third tier in the three tiers will be the presenting partner. So there's some leeway in how you can do that. How much should your tiers be? Well, there's no easy answer. You want to look at cost per attendee. You want to see what your budget is, but if you're thinking about the three tiers, then having something like 10%, 20%, 40%, or something like 15%, 30%, 50% of your total budget, those are some pretty good numbers for your tiers for sponsoring a society or an event. But it's important to look at your budget and see, how much money do I need to raise?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>14:31.226</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then what kind of things should you apply to each tier? The important thing to realize is that sponsors will value whatever you say is valuable. So if it comes to doing a workshop, you say that your workshops are valuable, then you can put that on the top tier and they'll be, "Okay, great, that's going to be really valuable for me." When you say that resumes are valuable and you put that in the top tier, then they'll think that is valuable. You want to make sure that you're -- every step up each tier, you're adding something that is actually justifying the extra costs and adding something that is valuable. But getting involved in an event or with a society is a valuable thing in general, and you shouldn't worry that, oh, I'm not sure if this is valuable enough, and that's often times what people are worried about. The other thing that I would mention there is that tiers are just a guideline, they are to show people what is useful and what is available. But at the end of the day, you're going to end up negotiating a custom package for each sponsor.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>15:35.681</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So let's take a look at how you get in touch with sponsors and negotiate that custom package. So stop me if your sponsored process sounds roughly like email a random company, something happens in the middle, and then you get lots and lots of money. That's what it looks like to a lot of people, but this is insane. This makes no sense whatsoever. You need to have a solid sponsorship process that you're able to follow and make sure that you can close effectively. One of the questions on the issue on GitHub asked them what to do if we're kind of running out of sponsors because there are so many societies and events and stuff like that that there's not enough sponsors or sponsorship to go around. Well in the hackathon world, we hear this a lot of like, "Hey, there aren't enough sponsors because we've got 250 events in the season now. There just isn't enough money to go around." And people were saying back when there were nine events in the season, some people were saying, "Oh, there's not enough sponsorship to go around with nine events." We've managed to grow as a community to 250 events, and people are still saying, "Oh, no. There isn't enough sponsorship to go around." And, honestly the limiting factor is probably not going to be the amount of sponsors. It's going to be your ability to close sponsorship and your sponsorship process. And because so many times the sponsors for events and societies are local companies, which aren't going to be sponsoring many events or societies globally, so your sponsorship process is going to really, really help to make sure that you are actually getting the sponsorship that you need. This is the killer bullet.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>17:27.134</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So here's the sponsorship process that we as MLH suggest. You want to set your targets and do your research. You want to get in touch with them and have a phone call with them, and then make a proposal. And you want to relentlessly follow-up with them to kind of actually close. So when it comes to setting targets and doing your research, you want to figure out which companies you want to sponsor, and who the decisionmakers at the companies are. So you want to be able to kind of look at tech companies who are local, you want to look at who are sponsoring societies or events in your area, so maybe there are tech companies who sponsor meetups or conferences near you. Maybe there are companies who are sponsoring other societies at your university. You can go and speak to your university and ask, A, who do we have good connections with as a university? Who wants to recruit from our university? And you want to kind of draw up a short list of like, these are the companies we want to get in touch with. And then you want to kind of try and figure out who to speak to at that university. So you can use LinkedIn. You can search for people who have graduated from your university and now work at that company, and search for them on there, and that's an in for you. You can use a tool like Rapportive to try and find email addresses for the people you need to get in touch with. But the point is you want to have a list of companies and try and get a list of contacts at each of those companies.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>19:00.410</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Ideally the best way to get in touch is with some sort of introduction, so having somebody in your network and kind of trying to find that, trying to get a warm introduction. So speaking to people in the local tech community whom you know, speaking to your university are good ways to maybe get introductions. And again tools of the trade here is looking for people on LinkedIn who maybe work at that company and graduated last year from your university. Or again you can kind of try to do similar things with Facebook and Google, and just googling around people. One thing that's really kind of important is that when you're keeping track of who you're talking to, and you can use a CRM like Pipedrive or Hubspot's CRM, or Salesforce IQ to kind of keep track of that stuff, or just a simple Excel sheet. But the point is that you want to make sure that you're keeping track of who you're reaching out to.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>20:03.035</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So when you reach out to them your first thing should be to get on a phone call. You want to keep it short and sweet and say, "Hey, we've got such and such an opportunity, we'd love to get on a phone call with you at this time to talk more about it," or, "Can you put me in touch with somebody who is better to talk to," that kind of thing. You don't want to kind of bombard them with an essay on the philosophical importance of sponsoring your society, because they're just going to ignore that. So get them on the phone and tell them a little bit about your team and what you want to achieve. Ask them about what they've been sponsoring in the past and what kind of budget they're looking for, and generally let them do the talking. Ask them questions about what their metrics are, what they want to get out of a sponsorship and learn about what they want, so you want to learn and understand exactly what they want. Then, when you hear what they want, then you can come back to them and offer them something which you know that they would be interested in. So often people might get in touch with a company and they'll think, "Oh, this company is really interested in recruiting, so I'm going to talk to them about all the great recruiting possibilities that we have for our society." But it turns out that they're actually not interested in recruiting, they're interested in developing their evangelism and then they're not interested at all because you've been talking at them instead of listening to what they want. So you want to first of all find out what they want, and then talk to them about what you can offer.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>21:34.799</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">I know it sounds crazy to actually use your phone to phone somebody. But talking on the phone is standard in business. Nobody's going to sponsor you without talking to you on the phone first. So you might want to only keep it to email, but trust me, you want to actually get on the phone. I know that can be very intimidating sometimes, particularly if you're not used to standard business practices, like getting on phone calls with people every single day. But that's the way it's done. And the reason phone calls are so great is because you get instant feedback. Something which might take days to get done over 10 emails can take a minute just with asking questions on the phone. It's a very easy back and forth for finding out exactly what they're interested in and telling them what you can offer them in return. And finally, it makes you more trustworthy, because if you're only cold emailing people then they're kind of likely to think, oh, you might be a scammer or you're not really legitimate in some way. When you actually talk to them, you hear somebody's voice, and you start to trust them a lot more.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>22:35.119</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So after you understand what the sponsor wants and what you can offer them, you'll send them a proposal via email and explain why it fits their company's needs. Even if you've already done this on the phone it's important to still send over an email, because again they are going to need to share that email with their team internally so they're able to kind of show the rest of their team why it's a good thing. Again it's about giving them the tools to kind of sell you internally. It's also important to set a deadline for when you need to hear back from them by because you want to make sure that they actually tell you yes or no. Maybes and, we'll get back to you laters don't cut it. You need to know yes or no. Make sure though to ask for a follow-up call. Again that's kind of making sure that they actually make a decision. And be simple. Again don't send that essay on the philosophy of the importance of working with you. Just give them the basic arguments, just a couple of paragraphs, keep it simple.</p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>23:37.195</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And then finally you want to follow-up. And when I say follow-up I mean follow-up relentlessly. You want to get a yes or a no from them. Maybes or we'll get back to you laters, they're even worse than a no because you're going to think that maybe they're on board but actually they're not. So again, things you can do to help out with this is using a CRM. CRM is a piece of software that you can use to keep track of sales essentially, and you're able to tell when was the last time we got in touch with this person, who are the contacts of this company, who is owning this relationship. But again you can do that in a spreadsheet if you can't afford a CRM. Hubspot CRM is actually a free CRM that you can use if you're interested in doing that. You can use tools like Boomerang or Followup.cc in order to make sure that you're following up with people kind of on a weekly basis. And you can use things like MailTrack or [inaudible] to see when people are opening your emails, and know whether or not people are actually kind of considering your proposal.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>24:55.764</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So when it comes to your process, you want to watch out for maybe not iterating. So you want to always be improving your process, getting any feedback and kind of improving things. Also make sure to practice. Sometimes people will get a list of 100 companies and they'll send them all emails all at once, but really a better thing to do is to send an email to one company and kind of get used to the process of one company and then maybe try it out with a couple more. And you're going to be iterating and improving and finding something that works for you. And then when you're comfortable with it, then you can kind of go out and start speaking to dozens and dozens of companies at a time. And the final thing to watch out for is not closing. You need to make sure to follow up and actually close events.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>25:45.166</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So here are a couple of pro tips, just kind of go over at the end there. One thing is you want to make sure that you're under-promising and over-delivering. When you're selling through to the sponsors, it can be very very tempting to want to make your society or your event look bigger or better or greater, because you need to make something look really really good if you want to sell it, right? But fundamentally, first of all you shouldn't feel insecure that your society or event or something isn't going to be good enough to be able to interest sponsors. Trust me, it's going to be good. Sponsors love getting involved with university students, students in general, really, really value [inaudible] sponsors, so don't be worried about that. But also it can be very, very damaging for you and for your relationship with your sponsor if you tell them that an event is going to be, or a society is going to be amazing and fantastic and you'll do all these things and then it doesn't really do that in the end. So what you want to do is under-promise. Tell them it's-- if you're trying to get an event with 100 people there, tell them it's going to be 70 people, and then if you manage to get 100 people or maybe get a little bit more, 110 people, they're going to be overjoyed. They'll be like, "Oh wow this is way much better than we expected and this is phenomenal." And that's a great experience for them, and they're going to be more likely to come back and work with you in the future.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>27:15.435</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Make sure to follow up with your sponsors after their period of sponsoring or after their event. Send them surveys to find out more about what you could be doing to help them. Write them a handwritten thank you note. That's a really kind of low hanging fruit, so do something personal for them and send them a recap to kind of show a little bit of statistics about their sponsorship and photos. And again, that's really useful for them because they're able to share that internally and get more budget for you for next year. Also make sure to actually sell your team and your expertise. The fact that you are a GitHub Compass expert means that GitHub has placed their trust in you and thinks you're really awesome and they're there to support you and help you out. And that's a really valuable thing because it means you're a pro, you're pretty damn good. And assigning that expertise to a sponsor makes them feel a little bit more comfortable that like, "Hey, there's a support structure in there and I know this person's going to do a good job." It's the same thing with hackathons, is that like if a hackathon says we're working with Major League Hacking then it kind of shows that they're working with the experts, and helps that kind of look of legitimacy.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>28:31.493</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Again, remember that this is a professional business relationship and that means you need to have regular and timely communication before, during, and after the sponsorship. So make sure to respond to your sponsors quickly and fully and make sure to keep up with them after the sponsorship as well. Send them a recap, answer any questions they have and try and re-up them for next year. Also when it comes to kind of making kind of custom packages for sponsors, you should be willing to negotiate and be like, "Okay, well, we'll be able to take it to a discount for you," or something like that. But don't go too far and don't give away the keys to the castle. Somebody asked on the GitHub issue, we get a lot of people offering in-kind sponsorships and what should we do to try and get them to give us money? Honestly you just have to tell them, "Sorry, we're only looking for financial sponsors. We're going to have to turn you down." If you're comfortable, if what they're offering is good, but you still need to get a little bit of money, maybe ask for a little bit of money on the side plus the in kind sponsorship. But at the end of the day if you just say no, say no. It's totally fine to tell somebody, "Sorry.

But something to bear in mind is that it is possible just to invoice a sponsor for a particular service or package. That is a totally legitimate way of doing it too. And if you're doing a contract and not wanting to go through the company's legal department, which might take a lot longer, so that's adding even more to the billing cycle because it has to go through a legal cycle first, and then they have to have your purchase order, and then you have to do an invoice and so it might take a lot longer if you do it that way. And it might even also have to go through your university, like a contract there. One thing to bear in mind is that your university or your student union might have a standard sponsorship contract you can use which would be very, very helpful, and also how this works, and the legal advice varies by country, so you should actually, if you're going to do that, go and get some professional legal advice from a lawyer in your country. And again your university oftentimes will be able to provide that for free.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>31:28.309</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Great. And finally at your university if you want to go and get something from your university it's a very, very good thing to find an internal champion. So that's somebody on the faculty, like a professor who will be able to fight your corner, because so often the administration or university, they don't listen to students sometimes. But they're more and more likely to listen to somebody who's a professor. So find a champion to fight your corner inside the university. That can be really, really useful.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>31:59.049</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So lastly, let's just go over a couple of common pitfalls. One of the worst things that you can get is a maybe. So when a company says like, "Yeah, we might sponsor," you want to actually really find out why they're not sure and alleviate that concern. And you need to either turn it into a yes or a no, because a yes is great. It means you're able to close them. Fantastic. You close them quickly and get it all done. And a no is also great because it means you're not wasting your time on them. You're not thinking, "Oh maybe we have this much money." But actually, you don't. So you want to make sure to turn that into a yes or a no. Also something to bear in mind is that when it comes to closing a sponsor, a yes only counts either when you get your money into the account, or when you sign a contract. And even then sponsors sometimes try and get out of contracts because sponsors might drop out for some reason. Like sometimes there are just reasons that sponsors need to drop out. So you should only take something as a certainty when you get the money into your account. So try and, as soon as you get that yes, immediately start the invoicing process, get them invoiced, get that money into your account as quickly as possible so you're certain that they're locked in. So often I speak to events and they're like, "Oh yeah, we've got about £10,000 or something." And I'll be like, "About £10,000? Why don't you know exactly?" And they'll be like, "Oh well, such and such a sponsor might be giving us £5,000." Like well, you can't count that money because if it's a might, if it's a maybe, it just doesn't count. Also not understanding payment cycles, really, really bad pitfall. Cashflow is very important and sorry.

It's really annoying too, the slidedeck's too good. Just I think that's a question you answer in the next section.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>34:08.448</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Where am I at? Next up, not understanding payment cycles is a really big pitfall. You need to make sure that you have cashflow ready to pay for things for your event. And when you're invoicing companies, and it might take some time for that money to actually hit your account, and even when it hits your account, if you're working with your student union or your university, sometimes accessing that money can be difficult and it can take some time to actually access that money. So make sure you understand exactly how long it's going to get your money, and how long it's going to take to be able to spend your money because otherwise you might find yourself in a tough spot. And finally one of the biggest problems that I often see is people not valuing what they're selling. And it can be very difficult to go and ask for a company for thousands and thousands of dollars worth of money because it feels like it's a lot of money. And what you're actually doing for them is really not that much. But it's important to understand that, first of all companies, they've got large budgets to work on developing evangelism and to work on recruitment, and work on marketing. The businesses are a lot, lot bigger than what you're asking for. And also what you're providing is actually really, really valuable to them. Remember that they're willing to pay a premium for a targeted audience. So what you provide, even a if it's simple, just a workshop or some branding or being able to come and speak to students, that's actually very, very valuable for people and you shouldn't undersell yourself. You should, if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable about the amount of money you're asking for it's kind of a good thing because that means you're asking for the right amount. If you're feeling comfortable about like, "Oh yeah, I'm okay asking for that amount of money," probably means you should be asking for a little bit more. So just make sure you're valuing what you're selling. Finally are there any questions? I know, Joe it's a new thing [crosstalk]--<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>36:12.030</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Yeah, absolutely.

Yeah so I was thinking the whole way through about questions I could ask you that the experts might ask, and you wouldn't have had the [inaudible] and the only thing-- there are a couple of things I think would be good to expand on. So firstly that you mentioned the importance of phone calls which I know is something you've spoken about before. I believe you spoke on it at hackcom. I think you covered like really well why the people should be getting phone calls. I was wondering if you had any tips or resources like picking up your first business conduct over the phone, as someone who's new to engaging in a business conversation over the phone, where do you go and get those skills and get the, I guess the etiquette, do you have any advice on how to pick up that ability?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>36:56.795</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Yeah, so I think one of the best tips that I have is using something like Skype or Google Hangouts, because it seems that people are way more nervous speaking to other people on the phone than we are speaking to them in person. Like I'll see a lot of people, a lot of students will be totally happy to meet a potential sponsor and talk to them about their event and ask them if they'd be interested in sponsoring in person, but as soon as it comes to the phone it, for some reason it just gets very, very nervous. So doing something where you can see each other's face can be really, really valuable in feeling a little bit more comfortable and kind of getting used to talking to people [inaudible]. And again if you're not able to use Skype or something, maybe they're based locally and you can go and speak to them in person. You can go have coffee with them or something. And again that's just an easy way to dip your toe in the water and get used to talking to people about these issues without doing it in such an intimidating way as a phone call. I think the other thing that I found helpful while starting out speaking to people on the phone was having a very clear script in my head for like, "This is how I'm going to promote this event." Or, "This is what I'm going to say about this." And practicing and saying like, "Okay, when it comes to describing the event, I have this short couple of sentences. This is what I'm going to say for this." So probably something prepared can be helpful for talking about certain topics. I think when it comes to etiquette, that's an interesting question. Do you have any thoughts on how to kind of learn more about general etiquette? Because this is something that oftentimes you just learn by osmosis in a way.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>38:48.982</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Yeah, absolutely. I mean I think your first part of the question answered that. I guess, as you say you learn it by osmosis. The way to learn is to get onto a phone call so you can get into the phone call better, and if videos help you do that then you've got to learn it. So that's awesome. I think the [inaudible] about using video itself is actually again really interesting. One of the things I always struggle with whenever I have a phone call in a traditional conference line, is telephones have delays and telephones don't really allow two voices to be going on at once. So it's always very rude. It's like you interrupt someone because there's a delay with that and then you end up with that weird moment where one person's saying, "No, no, go on." But you are also saying,"Go on." And neither of you speaks for a while. And which you don't get by Hangouts and by Skype, so that's awesome.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>39:30.424</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Yeah. [crosstalk]. Just on that point, one thing that's useful to note is that people in business, in a company, is they understand this. They know that something is awkward, and they know you're a student, and they know that you're only learning and you're starting off, and they're going to be forgiving. You shouldn't worry, "Oh, my God I'm going to make a fool of myself." No, you're not. It's going to be fine. Seriously, it's totally cool.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>39:57.239</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think it's very easy to overcompensate with professionalism, and that's where you get ludicrously long emails and really high language and really what we want to hear in your response is, "Hey, here's how much it costs. Are you up for it?"<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>40:10.529</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And you get often, I get emails that are like, "Dear Mr. Fogerty," and I'm like, "You can just call me Tim, it's fine [laughter]."<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>40:21.518</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">The other thing, and again this is something you mentioned a couple of times, and I agree, it'd be great [inaudible] really well. You spoke about obviously enabling the sponsor to help you so giving them the info, need to go back to the team, and then after the event giving them the info then to almost justify what they've done. So on the things that MLH have [inaudible] give you a fantastic report after. And you mentioned doing reporting, that sort of thing, and some events are already doing this. I wonder if you could give some insight into what information you have found it useful for events to gather, to provide to sponsors afterwards. What are the actual metrics that you think are broadly useful to track?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>41:00.752</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Yeah. So this is something that you will need to-- there's two types of things that you want to track and report on. The first one is just general information, and the second one is you need to talk to your sponsors and find out that what they are interested in tracking. Because they might be interested in tracking, "Oh, how many coupon codes do we give out?" Or they might be interested in tracking, "How many people dig our prize?" or maybe they're not interested in those at all. Maybe they're just interested in, "How many people came up and spoke to us at our table?" And we need to find out what metrics they are interested in, and what metrics they report on internally and ask them. You can just ask them, "Oh, hey what kind of metrics do you have? What kind of things you're tracking, what would you be interested in getting?" And sometimes they'll have a number or something that they're tracking, and you're able to say, "Well, we'll figure out a way to track that and report that back to you," and that's going to be great. So in general, basic things like attendance and general kind of statistics, like for hackathons for example, we tell them how many projects were made, and then we'll tell them how many projects were made on on their kind of form we're using there. Their challenge, we'll give them a breakdown of the demographics which could be interesting for them as well. And photos. Photos are really, really valuable because it shows, wow, this is a real thing and this is cool and exciting. So making sure they get photos and also things like maybe social media impressions, stuff like that, are good general things to report on, but also there are specific things you should ask your sponsors, "What do you want us to report on?"<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>42:37.158</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Absolutely, yeah. The focus is the really interesting one. I did a thing once at a company, where the CEO actually went like, "Right, did you do that?" Well, I take a photo of a workshop room and then counted the people in it later on in order to say how many people actually showed up to the workshop. So if you can provide full shot photos of workshops and events, and you get your photographers to capture those, you can actually use those for reporting later on, so which is another kind of extra perk to taking awesome photos. All right, cool. I think that's most of the questions I wanted to ask you. Is there anything else you want to add?<br /> </p></blockquote></div>
