## Introduction üëã

In this module, you'll learn about the Atom editor and how to hack this hackable editor! You will become familiar with the atom editor and create a your first plugin. Kim delivered this tutorial for Local Hack Day 2016. You can find a written tutorial in the resources folder, complete with all the code shown in the video.

Atom plugins are a great topic for learning developers, for many reasons. Being able to customise your developer environment and the plugins you use is a huge step to becoming a skilled developer. Additionally, Atom plugins make for a great first entry into open source! After this module, why not look at the repository of your favourite Atom plugin and see if there's anything you can do to help? Atom plugins are especially exciting topics for workshops for new programmers: moving from dabbling with Javascript on the web, to adding functionality to a text-editor feels very powerful, so don't forget to think about how you can share this new knowledge with your campus.

## Exercise üìù

The exercise in this module is to take your first hacking steps with Atom by creating a plugin, as simple or complex as you are comfortable with. The full description can be found in the exercises directory of this repo.
