## Introduction 👋

In this module, you'll learn about the atom editor and how to hack this hackable editor! You will become familiar with the atom editor and create a your first plugin. Kim delivered this tutorial for Local Hack Day 2016.

When following a technical workshop in the Campus Experts training, the foremost thing in your mind should be "How can I share this knowledge with my community?". As you participate in the workshops and go through the exercises, think how you can present these concepts to your own peers, and what problems these technologies might solve, that are relevant to your community.

## Exercise 📝

The exercise in this module is to take your first hacking steps with Atom by creating a plugin, as simple or complex as you are comfortable with. The full description can be found in the exercises directory of this repo.
