# Create an Atom plugin

This exercise is to write your first Atom plugin! It can be as simple or complex as you are comfortable with, the important thing is to learn about the process of creating one so you are able to use and teach others about Atomâ€™s hackability within your community.

## Task

Your task is to create your own plugin. The resources includes a detailed tutorial on building a dictionary lookup plugin so please create a different one. Try to think of a plugin you've seen and used in other editors or maybe a one you'd like to have but doesn't exist yet!

Once your plugin is tested and ready to go, include it in a file called "module-13.md". You can copy and paste the code into this file, or you can link to a gist or repository. Submit them using the instructions below.  

## Bonus activity

If you're feeling up to it, consider publishing your plugin for others to download and use!

One important note before you publish a package, it is a good idea to check ahead of time if a package with the same name has already been published to the [atom.io package registry](https://atom.io/packages). You can verify by visiting https://atom.io/packages/your-package-name to see if the package already exists. If it does, update your package's name to something that is available before proceeding.
You can find the full instructions on publishing here: [Publishing](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/publishing/).
