# Write an Electron app

In this exercise, you will create, package, and share an Electron app.

## Task

- Think of a JavaScript app that would be a good candidate for a standalone cross-platform desktop application. This could be an app that already exists (such as on [CodePen](https://codepen.io)), or one that you write yourself. If you choose to use an existing app, ensure its license allows you to use it. As an example, here's [CodePen's license](https://blog.codepen.io/legal/licensing/).
- Port your chosen app to Electron.
- Package the app for multiple Operating Systems.
- Share your app in a public location.
- Include a link to the app and the repository in a file named "module-12.md"
