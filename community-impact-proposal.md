### Where does a business major interested in tech start? :bow:

When it comes to my goal as a Campus Expert, it's simple, be the go-to person for any non Computer Science or technical major for that matter, when they want to get started in tech. In the College of Business alone there are about 10k students. If every college on campus has about the same number that's about 40k+ students that might want to get involved in tech and just don't know how. This is where I come in, my simple understanding of tech (which is constantly growing) makes me the ideal person to explain tech in a simple and understandable way for those who haven't taken any programming or computer science courses ever!

Everyone in this community is so eager to learn as much as possible in order to get ahead whether it be personally or professionally.

### What can I do about it?

I would like to create a workshop or set of workshops, that give you a foundation in CS and programming.

As a marketing major, I also want to make the opportunities more accessible to students outside of the CompSci program. This includes making sure they know about the upcoming hackathons and how they can contribute. As the fall semester gets under way, everyone is deciding what organizations and extra curriculars they want to commit to. A set of workshops that I would plan this semester and execute in the Spring would be ideal for anyone who might have a fire in them waiting to be kindled.

With this proposal I am aiming to impact non-CS majors. People who have an interest but no formal training in computer languages or computers in general. I feel as we progress to the era of technology it is important for everyone to have a base knowledge in computer science. To do this, I first need to learn myself which I'm already doing by completing these modules!

Thankfully I have the help of my fellow MangoHacks organizers who also want to see the tech community grow and diversify in Miami/South Florida.

Once the workshops are given, I would sit with my team and evaluate. Being a marketing major, research is a big role in my career. Focus groups and surveys would be a great way to hear feedback regarding the workshops by attendees.
