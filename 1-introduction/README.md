## Welcome to Campus Experts üëãüö©

Campus Experts are students passionate about building technical communities on campus, with training and support from GitHub. We all learn better when part of a group of likeminded individuals. When surrounded by our peers, we can be supported, have a surface to test ideas against, and have greater access to more diverse knowledge. At GitHub Education, we believe there is no place this is more true than at school, or on campus.

By taking part in this training, and becoming a Campus Expert, you will be joining a group of people trying to make learning about tech easier, and more accessible. You will learn skills needed to lead communities, create and present technical content, and communicate effectively with others. Throughout the process, you will have the support of GitHub and other experienced Campus Experts, who have such a wealth of experience with a wide range of different communities and subject areas. Once you become a Campus Expert, you'll unlock perks and resources for you school, such as swag and sponsorships, whilst continuing to benefit from new learning opportunities and mentorship.

So let's get started with our first training module, and talk a little bit about what makes a productive, healthy campus community.

Community on campus takes many different forms. Communities can be informal gatherings of people interested in the same topic, just sharing a space on a week night evening. Or they can be organisations with a shared constitution and annual elections, responsible for creating spaces for thousands of people. You might already be familiar with something near you that sounds like one of these: it could be a club, a study group, or a local hackathon.

Despite these many forms, all successful communities have one thing in common: they are made up of people with a shared experience of adversity.

Another way of saying this is they share stories of a common struggle. That common struggle could be trying to get a good grade in a computer science degree, or overcoming bias in an industry where you don't feel represented. That struggle could be something as simple as trying to learn about a new technology.

A community formed around a common struggle has a sense of urgency. This unites members, and gives them a clear focus for productivity. The presence of shared experience cements the group: it helps new members feel like they belong, and builds relationships between members.

Although having a clear mission is a hallmark of successful communities, it isn't a magic bullet. The problem statement can be too broad, or ill-defined. Some of the most commonly encountered problems that campus communities face are caused by trying to tackle a broad problem. It's important to separate a shared _environment_ from a shared _struggle_. A shared environment may produce multiple struggles, meaning a community formed around a shared environment lacks the focused urgency. An example is a degree club, i.e. a club for the department of computer science.

_What different shared struggles might a group of students in a computer science club have?_

As you think about the campus and the people in it, think about what struggle you want to address. What problem do you want to tackle for your fellow students? That is a great starting place for a community.

Let's have a look at an example of an existing and highly successful community. In the video for this module, you'll find a talk by Emma and Andrew Seward of TechNottingham. TechNottingham is a technical community in the city of Nottingham, in the UK. In this video, Andrew and Emma talk about the community, their philosophy, and some of the tools, techniques, and events they use to bring that community closer together.

_What common struggle does your community have?_

Now that we have some idea of the core of a successful community, how do we move to make that community a reality? The other modules in the training hope to provide some of the answer to that question. But there's a lot of modules to choose from, so let's talk about how you can define what your community needs.

In the exercises document inside this module, you will find a couple of exercises to complete. These are the community assessment and the community impact proposal. The community assessment is a tool of sorts that helps you analyse, or define, the community on your campus. Where it is now, and where you want it to be. The community impact proposal is where you define how you'll move your community between the two: it helps you construct a plan and goals. Once you have analysed your community, and made a plan, you'll have a much better idea of which modules to study. For example, you might analyse your community and determine that it's focused around helping new students learn about web technology. You have a core group of passionate students who know lots about web development, but you're not sure how to convey that knowledge. Well the public speaking and workshop modules might be for you. Or maybe you're part of a community that's been around for a while, but your membership has stopped growing, inactivity is high, and rifts are starting to open. In that case, the community management and inclusive community modules might be ideal for you. It may be the case that you discover you need something we don't yet have a module for: if you have module requests, you can make suggestions by opening an issue.
