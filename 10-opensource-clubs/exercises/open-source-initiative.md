# Open Source Initiative

This exercise is to provide three artifacts.  
The following steps are required in order to complete this module.
1. Update your impact proposal to include how you will incorporate open source into your community. Include the new community proposal in your Module 10 submission. (Please note, do not go back and update your Module 2 PR).
2. Include a club proposal. This can include, but is not limited to, a constitution, visioning document or another form that is required for you to become a new club on campus or for your club to exist at your university.  This form is not only required from your university, but it will help you better envision and pursue your club journey. It will help you in thinking about long-term, on how to be sustainable and how to grow your club.
(Note the impact proposal and the document required by your university may be very similar and that is okay).
3. Discuss at least one activity or event you will host to bring open source to your club. Provide details on how you will execute this activity/event.


## Task

1. Updated impact proposal.
2. Document required/submitted to your university for your club to exist.
  - If your university or community does not require documentation please discuss your situation and how you plan to ensure the continued success of your club. If you are having trouble, follow the tips below and submit that as your document for this part.
3. Outline of your open source activity/event.

### Tips on what to include:

- Make sure to give your club a name.
- State the purpose/mission. Talk about the unique niche the club is addressing.
- Describe the benefits and activities your club will offer.
- A good point to address is how the club falls under the university's/student union's/etc mission. Try to include how the need is not currently being met on campus.
- State how the club can continue to grow in the future.
- Will the club made up only of computer science students?
- How will your club communicate?
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
- Submit your artifacts using the process below.
