## Research campus clubs

When taking steps to create your club on campus, a good first step is to begin finding out the important details from your university. These details will be the building blocks you will need to launch your club.

Begin by researching other clubs on campus. A good place to look is at various websites like your university's main website, your student union's site, department/faculty associations sites, etc. You may be able to find these links in your student agenda if there is one or you may find this information by conducting a quick internet search.

You want to ensure that when you present your initiative that there doesn't already exist an organization on campus serving this need. If it does or if there exists a general purpose group that you'd fall under definitely reach out to that group to collaborate.

#### For new club creators, who is my club?

Read through the two following questions and come up with answers.

- What groups currently exist on campus?
- What umbrella organization would the group fall under, if any?
- Is there required training required for all and any groups on campus?
- What is the timeline for creating a new club on campus?
- Are they are important deadlines for applying to become a group, and if so what are the requirements?

You should have a good idea of who to approach to start the conversation of applying to be a recognized club.

#### For existing club creators, who is my club?

- What resources that you can think of right now that you have or that you will need to bring open source to your current club?
- People want to get involved in your community, how could open source play a role in that?
- How will integrating open source into your club affect your impact proposal?


## Start the conversation

A good next step to research is beginning the conversation of becoming a recognized club. Since we figured out where you fit in the university, initiate contact with that entity. It will be important to initiate conversation and to find out what documentation and requirements are needed.

While starting the process of applying to become a club reach out to faculty members to gain their support. It can be beneficial to have faculty support. Faculty members are often more than willing to lend a hand and/or provide resources. Such resources could include helping with finding and booking space on campus, obtaining funding, provide access to professionals in the industry, and much more.


#### Contents for my club application
Make a list of the application details and requirements you need to meet. Some of the documentation that you may need to produce can include:
- Internal application
- Constitution
- Proposal
- Code of Conduct
- Budget
- Presentation

So we've done our research, we've started the conversation, now let's put things in motion. By now you should have an idea of what is required of you to become a recognized club on campus. Developing the artifacts will not only be necessary to become a club, but they will help you better envision and pursue your club journey.

## What does a successful club look like

  - **Great communication**
   Great communication starts with being transparent about the mission of the club, identifying what students will get out of being a part of this club, and what they should expect. It is good to have a clearly defined means of how members can communicate with leaders and with one another. Make sure all members and leaders are aware of the code of conduct and follow it.

  - **Meet regularly**
	*What’s regularly?* This is going to depend on your community. Our suggestion is to host an event/activity at least once a month, preferably bi-weekly. If you have the time and resources feel free to host events weekly! These are merely suggestions, you know your community best.

  - **Be inclusive**
	A great step towards being inclusive it by ensuring students have a place to submit their feedback. Are you providing means for open communication? An inclusive club is where member voices are heard and feedback is continuously reviewed  and acted upon. Again being transparent about how/why situations are handled, events being hosted, etc. A successful club is one where it’s not just the leaders guiding the conversations, but members are influencing and leading conversations.

  - **Be engaging **
	Ask member questions, ask for their feedback, and get them wanting to participate. Your club is engaging when people are involved. They are participating, they are learning, they are asking questions, and they are bonding.

  A successful club isn't based on numbers, but is painted by a picture of students coming together and  creating/maintaining/contributing to an open source project(s).


## Introducing open source to your club

Open source is a novel way of structuring the way we build software and execute ideas. It empowers anyone and everyone to take power into their own hands by fixing their own issues, defining directions for future development and working towards something much larger than oneself. This approach to building software puts contributors in a position of being recognized leaders, altruists, and no-brainer hires for some of the most prolific software companies in the world.

A good way to introduce Open Source is to define what we mean by the term "Open Source". Open source refers to projects that make their content available for others to inspect it, learn from it, enhance it, and share it. It also refers to the methods that allow this type of open collaboration to run effectively. Open source content is traditionally thought of as code, but content includes documentation, data (CSV files, raw binary blobs, and visualizations), images, publications (books, magazines, scientific papers), and snippets of text (cheatsheets, recipes, RFCs, etc). One of the first first steps will be communicating to your club that it is not only software projects that can be open source. For this reason, you should continue to refer to the inner ingredients as content and not source code.

These laudable ambitions and textbook definition of open source can morph slightly in practice. While some projects remain healthy and full of life, open source projects take a lot of work so it is inevitable that differently projects might function differently. While some are more likely to adopt modifications others might be more hesitant or even reject suggestions all together. This differences come from many factors including the commitments of leaders and creators, overall adoption, and some degree of randomness. It's possible that you make your project open to the public, but have no plans to maintain it or accept changes others might suggest. This is not inherently negative, simply putting your work on display help you hold yourself to a higher standard for quality and allows other to learn for the patterns and choices you implement.

By working openly, transparently, and collaboratively we can achieve and accomplish much more. Having community involvement in building tools for the community is essential. Our willingness to collaborate and share makes the tools and resources we build more useful and powerful.

## Outlining project structures

Now that you and your club can imagine the different types of projects people pursue, you can share the building blocks that make up an open source project and the surrounding methodology.

### Anatomy

Here we will dive into the different components that make up an open source project.

#### Roles in the community

- **Maintainers**

   A maintainer of an open source project is the one, or part of the one, responsible for leading the project and guiding the direction in which the project will continue to progress.

- **Contributor**

  A contributor is someone who takes part in improving and contributing to the project. In component 2, Getting involved, we discuss what a contribution looks like.

- **Member**

  A member is someone who actively uses the project.

  #### Common files and their meaning  

When browsing most open source projects, you'll some of these files and understanding their significance will help you navigate the project and work towards becoming a contributor.

- **License**

  To officially recognize an open source project it must have a license attached to it. The license addresses and describes how the project can be used, copied, distributed, and modified.

- **README**

  The README usually contains instructions on how to setup the project, how to get started, and what the project does. Think of it like an instruction manual! But shorter and more practical :)

- **Contributing guidelines**

  Contributing guidelines and documents tell us how we can contribute and participate in the project. Since every open source project is different, these will be the building blocks you need to contribute *effectively* for that specific project. If you find these in the project you are exploring it is a good sign that it is welcoming to beginners and new contributors. We will explore later what a contribution is, but to jump ahead a little guidelines could include how to file a bug report, how to request a new feature, and more.

- **Code of Conduct**

  The code of conduct indicates to us how the folks in the community of this project are expected to behave and act. It sets the ground rules to ensuring a healthy community around the project. The code of conduct address the expectations of how apply to proper conduct, when to apply, and most important what to do if a violation occurs.

#### Communication patterns

  - Issues
  - PR
  - Forums
  - Mailing list
  - And more.

##### Suggested Activity to do with your club
An exercise you can do with your club is to ask each one to explore open source projects and choose one you find interesting.

-  Write about why you chose the project, describe its structure, find out who are the maintainers, do they have beginner friendly issues, and talk about their contributing areas.
-  Talk about if you feel this a project you can begin contributing to that will be beneficial to becoming a great contributor to open source? Are there any patterns in how the communication channels (issue, pr, forums, etc) that you may or may not have expected?

## Getting your club involved

The open source movement proved that passion and collaboration can be combined to sustain large projects. The combination burns within community volunteers called contributors. If you've made it to this component it's because you possess that combo and are looking to become a contributor. So how do you contribute?

### What do I contribute to

It's not always easy to figure out what's the best way for someone to contribute to a project. Some common questions students ask themselves can include "_Do I work on problems I want fixed?_", "_Do I work on problems others are having?_", etc.

It's a common misconception that the only way to contribute to a project is through contributing code. It is important that you address this. There are a lot of ways to contribute that help a person get a feel for the process and the leaders of the project without worrying the extra layer of complexity introduced by writing code. Here is a short list of areas you can contribute to in a project:

- **Write documentation**

  Documentation is one of the most make or break challenges that a successful project must overcome. Contributing documentation forces you to test your knowledge of how the project works _and_ provides an often neglected service to the community for member, contributors, and maintainers. Writing documentation can manifest in explaining features that exist but are not sufficiently explained, translating existing documentation and editing existing content for readability, content, and grammar. Some projects, like the one you're reading right now, consist solely of written documentation.

- **Translate UI and documentation**

  As we become more connected through globalization and the internet, it becomes essential to enable communication between each other and ensure accessibility. By translating UI and documentation, you can unlock a project to the rest of the world. You allow others to benefit and empower diverse perspectives and unique contributions from a truly global community.

- **Create feature requests**

  If you're already an avid use of a project, helping define a direction or suggesting features can allow the project to better reflect the needs of its user. Coding up a new feature can be intimidating. Suggesting a feature provides a platform for maintainers and contributors to discuss implementation details with you and it also gives them a perspective that might be familiar with a project in a different way.

- **Write tests**

    Tests as a general concept provide a way for everyone to quickly know if suggested changes affect the way existing features behave. This helps keep a consistent experience for the end user and alerts contributors to unforeseen errors. While anything in excess can be detrimental, more unique test cases generally provide more visibility into behavior that might not get triggered often like error handling. Writing more tests, allows you to prove to yourself your understanding of the project and show an eagerness to get your hands dirty with the code. Especially if there is something that behaves differently than expected, the best way to communicate your circumstances is to write a test that _shows_ the difference between the expected outcome and what you may have experienced. If you are having trouble implementing a feature, writing the test cases and taking a stab at the feature provides an awesome jumping off point for asking for help.

- **Answer questions**

  Sometimes when StackOverflow fails us, we head to the Issues of an open source project to look for help. The Issues also provide a place for discussion of future direction. Contributing here can be really impactful. Answering questions, trying to recreate a bug report, and adding your input on ideas and refactoring can be a huge help to the (often over-burdened) maintainers. Answering questions can also manifest as triaging issues. A huge time sink can be recreating issues especially with the asynchronous nature of open source work. By helping to get all the necessary information from the person who created the issue is a huge asset.

### How can I be a great contributor?

Open source, just like any other team activity, is built on human interactions. Your contributions are often only as good as your approach and attitude in their bottom-line impact. By picking up tasks that members of your club feel comfortable with, trying their hardest and making helping them as easy as possible, they can gain the respect and admiration of other contributors. This is a huge step forward in their open source journey because they will have proven your eagerness to learn and aptitude for "fixing what is broken". Having this reputation will afford their attention of prolific maintainers who are the kinds of engineers who can help them grow exponentially.

The first step to being a valuable and great contributor is to truly understand that every project can operate differently. Understanding this will allow you to take a project's goal seriously and respect the procedures for contributing that are put in place by maintainer(s).

Maintainers put a ton of time and effort into the projects they maintain so a good contributor will be honest and vocal about their available time and skills. If you start something, make sure to finish what you started. Don't give up and prioritize completing it before starting a new contribution.
Most important, and a particular favorite, is make sure to be willing to learn new things and step outside your comfort zone!

### What if I have a question?

It's very common to have questions about a project when you first dive into it, or even if you've been contributing for a while. It's okay not to know everything. But before asking a question, do some searching.

A good first place to check is the README. A well written README should address where members and contributors can go to get help. Other good places to look for answers to your questions can include forums specific to the project , searching through open & closed issues/PRs, as well as searching on StackOverflow.

If you have done all the searching you can then figure out where and who you can ask. Some of these options include reaching out on slack channel, filling an issue, reaching out to the maintainer directly by e-mail or on a median like Twitter.

## What activities/events can I do with my Open Source Club?

Here are some suggestions of activities/events you can do with your club.

  - **Talk**
   Consider giving a talk on contributing to your first Open Source project or what you learned from it. Another idea is to try to find a maintainer or experienced contributor to come give a talk on their experience.
  - **Hackathon**
  Hackathons can be a great place to get started with Open Source. Consider hosting a hackathon where participants have to create an open source project like [Open Source Jam](https://itch.io/jam/open-jam-1] where participants have 72 hours to create an open source game.
  - **Workshop** A workshop or tutorial can be a great start to attract newcomers to open source. Having a step by step workshop guiding students could be a great start!
  - **Hacktoberfest themed event**  [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month long celebration of open source software brought to you by Digital Ocean in partnership with GitHub.

We are excited to see what you come up with for your community!
