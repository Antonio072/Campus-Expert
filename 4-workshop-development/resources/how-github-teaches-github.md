# How GitHub teaches GitHub

_The content below is edited excerpts from the recorded talk in the README.md. You can find the full transcript in the [resources](resources/) folder_

When newcomers first approach Git and GitHub, there is a dizzying array of choices. Take starting a new project, for example. A newcomer is confronted with the following choices:

- Create a new repository locally and push up to GitHub.
- Create a new repository on GitHub and clone locally.
- Clone or fork an existing project.

Each of these options has their own set of instructions, Git commands and concepts, and for a beginner, there's no obvious first choice. These choices make approaching learning about Git difficult, before we've actually even first started using it.

How can we tune this down so it's not just a million ways to do one simple thing? This is where we get into our Teaching Philosophy, and how we choose to teach. This is about "learners first": figure out exactly where the person is and meet them there. This is not always easy if you're teaching to a big group of people, as people will be in a different place. One person may be entirely comfortable on the command line, another may have absolutely no comfort level there, etc.

When we teach GitHub, GitHub Flow is a great common starting ground. Finding just one thing to focus on that everyone can grasp is enormous. The pace and order in which you approach topics is important. Git is complex, and it can be hard to grasp the base level concepts. If you start a conversation about Git around high level concepts such as branching strategies or rebasing, they're going to be lost from the very start. When you then discuss other concepts such as committing or what a branch is, or even what version control is, they're going to be relating everything back to those high level concepts you started with.

Talking about the GitHub Flow gives us an approachable order to the conversation. We have a tangible workflow to place the concepts in. We make a branch, we make commits, a pull request, we collaborate, and we merge. Everybody at any level can learn from that. It doesn't matter how well you understand Git, because we're talking about a way of working, a simple workflow that's just best practice. It's not esoteric, it doesn't require command line experience.

## Git or GitHub?

When giving workshops about using version control, one of the most common questions we get from students is whether to start with Git or GitHub. Often the instinct is to start with Git: after all, it's the underlying technology. It feels like it should be the foundation and the sensible starting place. However, let's approach this "learners first" and think about what we learnt above. A newcomer to version control, being taught Git, not only has to learn about version control and Git terminology, they also have to learn all of this in an unfamiliar environment, the command line.

This is a lot to take in at once. Whereas if we start with GitHub, it's a safe, easy and visual environment from which to learn the terminology and concepts. We can walk the class through a repository: what is the code tab, what is a commit, what is a branch and a pull request. A web interface is comfortable and familiar, they have more free attention to focus on the version control concepts. Once they've learnt about GitHub, the same is true of learning Git: they are comfortable with Git terminology and version control concepts, so they have more free attention to focus on the Git interface.

## On expertise

It's common to feel like you shouldn't deliver a workshop on a topic until you are an inarguable expert. Until you've devoured every written material, read the book and wrote the sequel, how can you possibly be qualified to teach? For an answer to this, we refer to a lesson in the public speaking module: the value of your experience is having moved from a position of "no experience" to "some experience".

If you've gone from knowing absolutely nothing about Git, to knowing something about Git, that is valuable experience you can share. No one is ever going to know anything, and if we only shared what we'd learnt once we did, we wouldn't get very far. The trick is to be comfortable in what you don't know. It can be intimidating when it feels like a student in the workshop knows more than you do. If you say something, and someone raises there hand and delivers a "well, actually", it's initially a devastating feeling. But it presents an opportunity. When asked a difficult question, learn to signpost: "I don't know, but I can find out for you" or "I don't know, but here's where we could find out". If someone corrects you or says something you didn't know, just say "Oh, that's really interesting, I didn't know that, thanks for sharing". It's incredibly freeing to be able to comfortably admit what you don't know, and it lends you credibility.
