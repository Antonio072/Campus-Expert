# Workshop Development üë®üèø‚Äçüè´‚ö°Ô∏è

## Learning Goals ü•Ö
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what differentiates a workshop from other public speaking opportunities.
- Understand the concept of "learners first", and how it affects pacing and the order of concepts you teach.
- Have applied what you learnt to creation of a workshop for your campus.

## Meet the trainers üçé

The content in this module is provided by Briana Swift and Cynthia Rich.

[Briana](https://github.com/brianamarie) and [Cynthia](https://github.com/crichid) are trainers at GitHub. The [GitHub Professional Services](https://services.github.com/training/) team provides training on all levels of Git and GitHub usage, including GitHub Desktop and Pages. They recently launched a new training curriculum for [GraphQL](https://services.github.com/on-demand/graphql/). Their [on-demand GitHub training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) is free and online to complete at your own pace.

## Introduction üëã

During this module, you will watch a talk by the Professional Services team at GitHub. The services team provides training for GitHub partners and users, for Git, GitHub and related technologies, like GraphQL. In the talk, Briana and Cynthia cover how they, as professional trainers, approach teaching GitHub. This talk will not only give insight into best practices for running a technical workshop, but will leave you prepared to deliver a GitHub workshop right away!
This talk is very interactive, with participation and stories from the Campus Experts attending. That style is actually at the heart of what makes a good workshop, which we will dig into a little bit below. This module also contains a recording of a GitHub workshop, this is good reference material if you want to go on and apply what you've learnt to GitHub.

This module goes hand-in-hand withe module 3, public speaking. Writing and delivering a technical workshop introduces some new challenges versus giving a conference or meetup talk. The key difference is interactivity: in a workshop, your audience is following along, and learning through practice. Because of this, when writing a workshop, you must be more aware of pacing and difficulty level.
You have to provide a workshop challenging enough to keep the most advanced in the class interested, whilst not too challenging to slow down the rate of completion and prevent the workshop being completed on time. Supporting the attendees plays a larger role, for example, you will likely want assistants to support the attendees as they complete the workshop. Having teaching assistants allows you to continue to direct the class as a whole, whilst they focus on individuals problems and help get stuck students up to speed again.

Another unique aspect of delivering workshops is that you escape the slideshow. You will likely want to demonstrate concepts live: this means getting into a text editor, console and browser, in front of a crowd. Performing technical activities live also adds complexity. Is your console font readable from the back of the room? What do you do if the internet connection is shaky? Do you have a backup ready in case you hit an unexpected bug? Technical demonstrations are useful and often exciting, but they can also backfire, and an ad-hoc bug fixing session may leave attendees more confused than enlightened. Be prepared, in order to keep the workshop clear and on topic.  

### Learners First üéìü•á

At the beginning of this module, we mentioned that the conversational style of the recorded talk is a prime example of good workshop practice. Why is this? There are several reasons.

Firstly, a workshop is not just a long lecture: the focus is on the attendees doing work. During a workshop, students will learn from you, but they will also learn from a variety of other sources. They will learn from themselves: prompt them to consider their past experiences and help them frame those experiences with new information. They will learn from each other, sharing and developing ideas with one another. They will learn from practice, you will give them work to complete and ways to experiment with the knowledge you're delivering. Be humble, and bring the focus to the student, not to you.

Secondly, sharing previous experiences helps you pace your content. Knowing where everyone is coming from, how much they already know about the topic, or where they've previously learnt, is an enormous resource. It will readily identify to you the advanced student who you may be able to lean on to support the others. It will let you know you can probably gloss over the first 10 minutes you'd planned, and go into more detail later. Or equally, that you might want to avoid a certain advanced topic. Knowing the students motivations is also vital. As we cover in the public speaking module, a solution isn't interesting unless it solves one of our problems. Knowing why your students are interested in this material will help you frame it in an engaging way, and relate it to their experiences.

You can read more about how a "learners first" approach informs pacing and concept order in the "How GitHub Teaches GitHub" document in the [resources](resources/) directory.

## Exercise üìù

The exercise in this module is to complete an outline for a workshop you can deliver on campus. A full description and a guide for what a workshop outline should include can be found in the exercises directory.
