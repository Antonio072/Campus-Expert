## Introduction üëã

Welcome to the Git Tips & Tricks module! This module is designed to help you better understand intermediate Git concepts, like setting up SSH for your repository, rebasing, squashing commits, and enabling your first Git Hooks.

We are assuming that you already have the basics of opening, cloning, and initializing a Git repository. We‚Äôre also assuming that you may have used the command line, but now we‚Äôll show you how to use GitKraken, should you choose to use it moving forward. üôè

We‚Äôve put together the content in a video series called ‚ÄúLearning Git with GitKraken.‚Äù The first few videos will explain the concepts via motion graphics and then follow up with examples using GitKraken. Once you finish watching the entire series, our exercises are here to help you test out some of these concepts yourself.

GitKraken does a fantastic job providing a visual layer on top of what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes, and it will be instrumental in your efforts to illustrate these basics to your fellow students. Keep this in mind the next time you need to present!

## Exercise üìù

One of the best things about using GitKraken, is how it helps visualize Git operations for beginners and pros alike. It‚Äôs one thing to type out git commands in the CLI, and another to do it in a GUI that visually shows you what you did with each command.  

Watch all the videos in this module before proceeding to the exercises, which will flex some of the core concepts. You can find a full description in the [exercises](exercises/)  file.
