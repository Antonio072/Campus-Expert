## Introduction üëã

_Did you know GitKraken Pro is available for free in the [Student Developer Pack](https://www.gitkraken.com/github-student-developer-pack)?_

Welcome to the Git Tips & Tricks module! This module is designed to help you better understand intermediate Git concepts, like setting up SSH for your repository, rebasing, squashing commits, and enabling your first Git Hooks.

We are assuming that you already have the basics of opening, cloning, and initializing a Git repository. We‚Äôre also assuming that you may have used the command line, but now we‚Äôll show you how to use GitKraken moving forward.

We‚Äôve put together the content in a video series called ‚ÄúLearning Git with GitKraken.‚Äù The first few videos will explain the concepts with motion graphics and then follow up with examples using GitKraken. Once you finish watching the entire series, our exercises are here to help you test out some of these concepts yourself.

GitKraken does a fantastic job helping you visualize what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes, and it will be instrumental in your efforts to illustrate these basics to your fellow students. Keep this in mind the next time you need to present!

## Exercise üìù

One of the best things about using GitKraken is being able to visualize Git operations. It makes Git commands that can be complicated and cubersome to memorize when using the CLI, as easy as dragging and dropping or pushing a button.

Watch all the videos in this module before proceeding to the exercises, which will help you put what you learned into practice. If you're ready, start the [exercises](exercises/) now.
