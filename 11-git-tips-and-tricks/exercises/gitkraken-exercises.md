# Git Tips & Tricks

One of the best things about using GitKraken, is how it helps visualize Git operations for beginners and pros alike. Itâ€™s one thing to type out git commands in the CLI, and another to do it in a GUI that visually shows you what you did with each command.

## Tasks

### Exercise 1: Creating SSH key pair

- Create your own SSH key pair manually. Follow the steps on this [GitHub help page.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key)

- Create SSH key pair for GitHub using GitKraken. Follow the video instructions or refer to our docs via our [SSH documentation page.](https://support.gitkraken.com/getting-started/authentication). Note: There is no need to set up a passphrase for this step.

*Questions:*
Write the answers to these questions in a file named "module-11.md".

- What is the value in using an SSH agent or GitKraken to setup your SSH keys?
- How could you help a Git newbie understand what's happening when they push and pull their contributions to their repo?


### Exercise 2: Enabling a GitHook

- Initialize a new test repository [from the command line](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init). You will need to first create a new folder called *test* before initializing git. (Note, we need to initialize from the CLI in order to get access to the default `.git/hooks` folder.)

- Navigate to your `.git/hooks` directory inside your repository. If you are on OSX, you may need to first [enable hidden folders.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11197249/show-system-files-show-git-ignore-in-osx_)

- You should see a list of GitHooks with `.sample` appended to name of each file. Open the `pre-commit.sample` hook in a text editor.

- This default pre-commit hook checks for lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when such a line is found. Rename this file `pre-commit` instead of `pre-commit.sample` from your text editor to enable to hook.

- Let's try to activate the hook in GitKraken! Open your test repo from Step 1 using GitKraken.

- Modify any file in your repo by adding a trailing whitespace, then save the change in your text editor.

- You should now see a WIP node at top of the graph in GitKraken. Select to stage your files.

- Commit your changes. GitKraken should detect your GitHook and provide an error---which is exactly what we want!

*Questions:*
Add the answers to these questions to your file named "module-11.md".

- Why would a team use GitHooks?
- How might you write your own custom hook? What would you want it to do?
