## Definition

>Current:

* Students interested in tech at Ashesi University College and part of Google developer group.

> Ideas: 
* Speak to other students not taking Computer Science or Engineering.
* Invite lecturers to our hackathons to collaborate with students.


>Ideal: 

* Any student interested in learning about tech and participating in hackathons.

> Ideas:
* Invite other students who are not from Ashesi to be part of this community.

## Size
* There are 10 people in the community.
* I will like to grow the community to like 20 or 30 people.
* There was no community before the Google developer group created the current community.

> Ideas:
* Organize more events where people can build working solutions to problems.
* Reach out to lecturers to be part of this program.

## Resource
> Current:

* Meetups organized by Google developers Group or Africa Technology Forum, school lectures and a code fair organized by our student council.

> Ideas:
Organize online sessions with expert developers.

> Ideal: 
* Meetups to learn new techs, Hackathons for people to come and develop things and learn from them, seminars and online tools for individual learning.

## Accessibility
> Current: 
* Meetings are usually in the evening from 6pm to 7pm so many students can attend because they usually feel tired after a long day of classes. Maybe in terms of content the session assumes a certain level of technological competency.

> Ideal:
* Meetings during the day or in the morning and provide a wide range of learning materials for less technologically competent students.

## Interest
> Current:
* The current community is mostly made up of computer science majors and they are not interested in any topic different from technology.

> Ideal:
* The community should be a mix of students from every major, the requirement should be that they are interested in technology.


## Goals
> Current:
* The community is made up of students who want to learn tech tools to complement whatever they learn in class and to be able to prototype their ideas. Most of these students hope to apply the concepts they learn in their CS classes. They are not very passionate about development because they are not driven.

> Ideal:
* Students who are passionate about development and therefore learn most of the tools on their own. Students who love to attend hackathon where they can build solutions to problems in their community. Students are interested enough to go beyond their in class requirements.

## Location
> Current:
* We meet on campus for events on a weekly basis.
* We freely get the location from the school and all participants are not far from campus and so commuting to campus is not a problem.
* We usually don't have fund to have snacks for all our meetings.
* The seats in our meeting room are comfortable and the room is large enough to hold all 10 participants.
* The space is not really flexible, it is a lecture hall organized in such way to really allow close interaction between groups.

> Ideal:
* In addition to the above mentioned, water and snacks for our meetings and changing our meeting space to one that can accomodate many space configurations.

## Communication
> Current:
* We use a whatsapp group for most of our communication. Apart from that we don't have anything else.

> Ideal:
* We would like to maintain the whatsapp group and have access to github account with ability to create private repository.

## Culture
> Current:
* We don't have a culture in place in our community.
* Not very open to new ideas.

> Ideal:
* Develop a code of conduct for the community.
* Have an open and safe space for people to share very crazy ideas.
