## Florida International University Business Students
### Can they make it in tech? :cold_sweat:
<br> I'd like to think so. :innocent:

### "MJ, who do you want to help?"
FIU is a diverse melting pot of cultures and interests. I mostly interact with the business students at my university being that they are in the same college as I am.

FIU's College of Business (COB) is home to about 10k students! Now, I am comfortable with the 10k students already in the community, what I would like to change is their interest in technology and become a reference point. I want to be the liaison between the tech community in Miami and the COB.

As FIU continues to grow, naturally, the COB has grown as well. I have even been contacted by my classmates when they see me typing away at my terminal and I always get the same question. "Hey MJ, you're a business student, what class did you take to learn to code" And my answer never changes, I learned not in a classroom but from friends who want to bring me into the tech community in Miami! Without them, I wouldn't have known where to start. (Shoutout to my MangoHacks team :heartpulse:)

### "MJ, how can YOU help them?"

I have long been interested in tech and the fortunately I was able to dip my toes in it because I met Angelo. He has been nothing short of great about teaching me the basics of CompSci. Unfortunately, for business majors there are not a lot of events hosted by the COB regarding tech. Should we want to learn more we would have to attend any of the CompSci events or MangoHacks. Realistically speaking, traveling out of our community (read: bubble) can be seriously intimidating and doesn't happen often.:disappointed:

At FIU we are given free access to lynda.com. This is great in terms of learning, however not as good as codecademy or codeschool which FIU does not provide for free. This would be something I would want to push at my school.

### "MJ, is your school making your mission any easier?"

We have a very tech forward campus and the building where most Computer Science majors spend their time is open to everyone. However, other than online, limited to lynda.com, there are not many resources.

Business majors try their hardest to make meetings and workshops after 5 pm because we assume people work from 9-5 in the business world. And there is even the Children's Creative Learning Center so childcare is covered!

### "MJ, are people even interested in tech?"

My community is mostly business students. I joined the MangoHacks organizing team and that is how I have started to frequent around CS Majors. There has to be a place where non cs students can "start" so to speak. I have asked my computer science friends where i should start if i want to get involved in tech and they all give me different answers. I want to create a starting point that lays out tech and computer science in layman's terms.

I have already had multiple peers ask me where they can get more info or more involved in CS once they see all the work I'm doing, how inspired I am and how much fun I'm having! I believe that FIU is a diverse community. Not only in the sense that we are from all over the world but we all have different interests. I would like to celebrate and emphasize that continuously within my community.

### "Ok MJ, you've told us all that, but why do you want to do this?"

People get involved with my community when they see something that sparks their interest. If they are not exposed to it, not very often will they have a natural curiosity. As someone who very rarely limits her interests and learning, this really bothers me. I want people to be able to learn what they want when they want where they want. Not knowing where to start is the biggest reason why people never make it past the occasional google search. :unamused:

These are mostly undergrad students trying to get the most out of their time surrounded by their peers. As is usually the case with business students, everything they do has to have a value added proposition. When they join different organizations and clubs, they hope it will give them skills or experience to enhance their resume.
I feel like, given the right catalyst, they will/can be passionate about dev.

As I mentioned before, I would like to create a starting point for people who are interested in tech but might be intimidated by the massive amounts of information available to them. I would like to create a curriculum of sorts in which they can indulge their curiosity. I want to be the go to person for business majors interested in tech.

### "MJ, where will you help them?"

FIU has 3 buildings dedicated to business students and we tend to spend most of our time between those 3 buildings. The COB has lots of socialization areas where we can/do meet. Parking for FIU students is free, there is metered parking available for non FIU students. There is even an app to plan what buses you need to take to get to and from your destination and you don't even need to be a student to get on the COB campus. There are lot's of auditoriums and computer labs for meetings and presentations. Being part of the professional business fraternity on campus I have access to all these rooms. These rooms vary in sizes from fitting 50 people to over 300.

### "MJ, how much access do you have to them?"

We rely on Facebook, GroupMe, Slack, WhatsApp and more depending on the organization you're in. Unfortunately, there is not one centralized method of communication for the entire college of business. This is one major thing I would want to implement.

### "Ok MJ, I think you've sold us, now tell us what the culture is like?"

Miami is honestly an overwhelmingly open place in the best way possible. I don't think I've ever heard of an instance where someone didn't feel welcome or heard. Communication is a big part of business and we all recognize that. We try to mediate disagreements quickly and professionally. On top of that the COB has a code of conduct which we adhere to strictly. I am a big believer in ethical business and will always do what is morally correct.
