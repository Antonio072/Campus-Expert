# Hey There!
My name is Miguel Hernandez.  I am a 3rd year (Junior) undergrad CSE major at UC Merced.
I am also a hackathon organizer for our university's MLH hackathon, HackMerced.

I love Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) because they bring world class education to everyone, which is especially
important in the tech world.  My goal is to help others within the tech community through the GitHub Campus Experts program.

Interests include full-stack web development, blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, and learning.
