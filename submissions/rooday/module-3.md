# Creating Your Own Ethereum-Based Token

## Abstract

Cryptocurrencies are the hot, (relatively) new thing right now. There exists all manner of coins, for all manner of reasons. Some compete to have the best underlying technology, whereas others exist solely to raise funds for a new startup. But, did you know that you can create your own cryptocurrency? While it may not be the simplest thing to do, creating and distributing a new cryptocurrency can actually be accomplished pretty quickly. During this talk, you'll learn some background on Ethereum, as well as the benefits and usecases of creating a custom token (cryptocurrency) on top of it. What you learn here might even make some :dollar:!

## Description

This talk will consist of a brief introduction followed by a coding workshop, so bringing a laptop is highly recommended (although the slides will be available online for you to follow at home). You'll create a custom cryptocurrency from scratch, using nothing but a text editor (any will do, so pick your favorite!). You'll also need the [Ethereum Wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) at the very end to deploy your token, which I suggest you download before the talk begins (WiFi has a habit of failing you when you need it most). Furthermore, this talk doesn't require any programming experience, however experience with languages similar to Java or JavaScript would be useful (for syntax familiarity). Regardless, you'll go home with your very own cryptocurrency!
