## Stretch goals

You've written an proposal, why not submit it to a conference?
- Check out [Papercall](http://papercall.io), [Technically Speaking](https://tinyletter.com/techspeak) or [Eventil](eventil.com) to find places to submit your talk.
- You could also look for [local meetups](meetup.com) that may be interested.
- Why not give the talk to other Campus Experts? :sparkles: Chat with Joe if you are interested.
