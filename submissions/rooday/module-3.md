# Creating Your Own Ethereum-Based Token

## Abstract

With all the hubbub around cryptocurrency as of late, I'm sure most of you have heard of Ethereum, one of the more popular cryptocurrencies at the moment. What you may not have known, is that you can create your very own cryptocurrency on top of Ethereum! Although it's not the simplest thing to do, most of the legwork has already been done for you, so creating an Ethereum-based token is actually not as hard as it may sound. During this talk, you'll learn a little background on the benefits and usecases of creating a custom token, as well as learning how to actually create and distribute one. Who knows, you might even make some :dollar:!

## Description

This talk will be very similar to a coding workshop, so bringing a laptop is highly recommended (although the slides will be available online for you to follow at home). You'll create a custom cryptocurrency from scratch, using nothing but a text editor (any will do, so pick your favorite!). You'll also need the Ethereum Wallet at the very end to deploy your token, but we'll go over how to download and set it up during the talk.  Furthermore, this talk doesn't require any programming experience, however experience with languages similar to Java or JavaScript would be useful (for syntax familiarity). Regardless, you'll go home with your very own cryptocurrency!
