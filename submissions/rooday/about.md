# About Rudy

Hi! I'm Rudy (but I will accept ROODAY or any other variation). I'm an undergraduate at Boston University studying Computer Science and Dance.
I got into programming and CS in general after a close friend showed me the soccer playing Lego robots he made. I took some classes in high school, and around the same time I went to my first hackathon. Since then (especially after starting college) I've been going to every hackathon I could.
Now that I've had some experience, I want to give back to the community that got me to where I am today!

## Interests

For CS, the fields of Machine Learning and AI are what interest me the most, although my current skill set is mostly in web development.
Outside of CS, I love dancing! My favorite style is hip-hop but if people are teaching anything else I'm always down to learn! 

## Contacting Rudy

If you need to email me, you can reach me at rooday@bu.edu. However, I'll probably respond the quickest on Facebook (under Rudhra Raveendran). I have accounts for most social media but I don't use them nearly as much.

## What's your favourite emoji?

I find :shipit: to be very amusing.
