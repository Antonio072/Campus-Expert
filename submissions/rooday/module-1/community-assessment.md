### Definition
A group of students who enjoy creating things, especially in a hackathon environment.

### Size
- **How many people are currently in your community?** At the moment, there are around 20 or so members that consistently show up to meetings, although the total number of members who are technically affiliated is much higher.
- **How many would you _like_ to be in your community?** Ideally, enough to fill the space we have reserved every week, so closer to 50.
- **Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?** I can't really be sure, as I came into the group just last year, and this year the leadership has changed. If anything, there is a possibility for the group to grow in the coming year as lots of changes to the group's format are going to be made.

### Resources
- **What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?** Every meeting is considered a hacknight, where members can work on projects and discuss software development with each other, learning through experience and discussion. On top of that, last year workshops were held once a month on a variety of topics, and this coming year the frequency of workshops will be increased.
- **Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?** Although there are no official office hours (at the moment), it's understood between members that it's always welcome to ask questions to each other. As for hackathons, there's several that exist in Boston, including a couple at Boston University itself, that the group goes to together. We also form groups that go to out of state hackathons.

### Accessibility
- **How accessible are the current resources in your community?** This is an interesting point, as it's something I wanted to work on in particular. The resources we have available are fairly easily accessible, the only issue is that not everyone is aware of them. We try to market workshops as much as possible, as well as nearby hackathons so we can send more people. One thing I'd like to do in particular is to reach out to the freshmen and let them know what's available as early as possible so they can take advantage of them.
- **Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?** Not for the majority of members, as meetings are 6-8 PM.
- **Is there childcare available?** Not at the moment. This would be one of the more difficult challenges to overcome as it requires (AFAIK) specific facilities that may not be close to our meeting location (or the Engineering Building at all for that matter). It requires further research into what BU offers that we could leverage.

### Interests
- **Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?** No, the group also has a few computer engineers, as well as some other majors like business and design. Last year we had a med student. Nonetheless, the group is predominantly computer science, and I'd like to incorporate more majors as they have different perspectives and skill sets that would be beneficial to the group.
- **Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?** The community is based around creating things and going to hackathons, both of which are incredibly broad. As such, topics of workshops could cover quite a lot, although last year they were all technical in nature. Going forward, especially in trying to attracts students of other majors, we could try holding workshops for different, yet equally important, skills like design.

### Goals
- **Why do people get involved in your community?** To meet other passionate people to work with, create cool projects, learn new things.
- **Are they students hoping to get a degree?** Yes.
- **Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?** Yes.
- **Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?** Double yes.
- **What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?** For the coming year in particular I'd like to have more workshops, and more importantly, go to more hackathons. Last year the groups that went to hackathons were fairly small and consisted of the same people. This year, I'd like to get new people to come along and at least get one experience of a hackathon.

### Location
- **Where does your community currently gather?** In the middle of campus, in one of the engineering buildings.
- **Is there parking, and if so, is it free?** There is parking, although I do not believe it's free. 
- **Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?** Yes, the location is right next a train stop.
- **Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?** Yes, as pretty much every part of campus is within a 15 minute walk of each other. As for people off campus, there is a train stop right next to the building in which we meet. (The entirety of the BU campus is covered by a train line)
- **How much does it cost to use the space?** Free, as we are a student group we're able to reserve spaces from the university for free.
- **How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?** Fairly flexible, we transition from presentation based workshops to general discussion/workspace. (The room itself is a design studio for the engineering building, and so could be used for a hardware workshop as well)
- **How many people can it fit?** Around 50 people comfortably.
- **Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?** Being a design studio, the seating isn't the most comfortable as they're all stools.
- **Is there water or snacks available nearby?** Food is usually provided when we workshops, however not for general meetings. Water fountains are easily accessible outside the room. Also, we have a tradition of going to a nearby nachos place to have a group dinner after meetings.

### Communication
- **How does your community get in touch with one another?** Generally through texting or IM services.
- **Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?** We have a Facebook page to stay on top of events, a group to send messages, a Slack channel for further communication, and a GitHub organization for projects that we all work on.
- **Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?** At the moment, communication is one of the things we do fairly well.

### Culture
- **How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?** I'd say fairly welcoming, however there is always room for improvement. Over the last year, there weren't really that many new members, only a handful of freshmen (myeslf included) became regular members. I'd like to increase that number for the following years. One thing I've noticed though is that once people have settled into their schedules they're less likely to commit to something new, which is why it's important to market the group and get members early.
- **What happens if there is a disagreement?** In the few cases where disagreements arise, they're sorted out calmly. I can't remember any time mediation was required, people tended to sort out their issues. However, it may be beneficial to let people know that they have people to talk to if they need to, as they might not know just from joining.
- **Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?** Outside of rules/procedures set in place by the school, no. There hasn't really been a need for documented procedures regarding group regulation, however it is something that I'd bring up with the rest of the group's leadership.
- **How will you personally handle it?** For overall culture, I'd like to have as many new people as possible so we can get as many new ideas and perspectives as possible. However, I understand that as the larger a group grows, the more disagreements would arise (the small size of the group probably attributed to the lack of conflict last year). Regardless, I'd do my best to ensure everything was handled civilly and that mutual compromises are accepted upon.
