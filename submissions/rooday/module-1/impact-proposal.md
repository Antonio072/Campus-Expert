## Summary of the Community's Needs

- **Community demographics**: Targetting a group of around 50 undergraduate students, predominantly studying Computer Science and/or Computer Engineering, but open to all majors. The group has access to weekly meetings at an easily accessible place on campus.
- **Communication**: The community prefers to communicate over Facebook (for events) and Slack (hackathon planning).
- **Culture**: Driven, passionate students who enjoy creating things, and are open to new perspectives and ideas.


## Your Proposal

**Project**: Attend more hackathons with more people from the community/BU in general

- **Timing**: Starting early in the semester but continuing throughout the year (basically throughout the hackathon season).
- **Community demographics**: I plan to increase the size of the community by marketing the group more and in different spaces, so that more people will be aware of the group's existence. I also plan on holding more diverse workshops to attract a greater variety of people.
- **Goals**: The community's goals revolve around meeting other passionate people, creating new things, and improving themselves to further their educations and careers. Participating in hackathons is a great way to meet new people and create new things, and at the same time learn information that would help both in the classroom and at a job.
- **Communication**: The community would continue to meet every week, attend regular workshops, as well chat over IM services like Slack. We'd also form groups and travel to hackathons together.


## Your Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- **Target audience**
  - **Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal?** Mainly CS and CE students who are interested in going to hackathons and/or gaining practical experience. However, I wouldn't be surprised if students of other disciplines, like business or design, wanted to come as well, as they also have skills that would be vital in a hackathon.
- **Community needs**
  - **What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?** Helping students gain practical experience and projects under their belt. An issue with BU in particular is that the CS program is very theory based, and few classes have projects. Getting students to participate in hackathons will help bridge the gap between classroom knowledge and practical experience.
- **Resources**
  - **What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?** The biggest obstacle in getting people to hackathons is travel. Interested students might be turned away by hackathons being too far and not offering travel reimbursements or busses.
  - **How will you obtain those resources?** I've spoken to my CS department and secured funding for travel to hackathons, which should allow the community to travel to hackathons farther out in the country, like at the west coast. I'll attempt to garner more funding by approaching other departments as well.
- **Media**
  - **How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?** In person, at the first few meetings of the year. I'll explain how I'd like to get more members and get more people in general to nearby (and far) hackathons. I'll show a presentation to inform people and get them interested about hackathons. 
  - **What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?** Speak to other leaders of the community and get their input, and also create a simple presentation explaining what hackathons are and how they're beneficial.
- **Content knowledge**
  - **How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?** I'd say fairly knowledgeable, I've been going to hackathons since I was a junior in high school, and now I'm on the organizing team for BU's hackathon.
  - **What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?** A group of other highly passionate hackers, a lot of whom have been at it longer than I have, that I can learn from.
- **Timeline**
  - **Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.**
    - Market the group more, especially to the incoming freshman, and get some new members
    - At one of the early meetings, give a talk about hackathons and get people interested, start forming groups and project ideas
    - Go to a nearby hackathon, like HackHarvard or HackUMass
    - At the next meeting after the hackathon, discuss how things went and what could go better, take the information into account and start planning for the next one

## Planning for the Future

- **When will you review the impact of your proposal?** At the end of the year/hackathon season.
- **How will you measure success?** By the number of new members in the community, as well as the number of new members who attended and participated in hackathons.
- **How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?** After each hackathon the group attends, I'll do a debrief with the group and see what they think went well and didn't go well, and improve for the next event.
