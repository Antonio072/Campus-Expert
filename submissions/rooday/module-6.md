## MakeBU Sponsorship Prospectus

**Define what you are raising funds for:**
  - A community. This includes a series of events (workshops, networking events, hackdays/hacknights), and if funds allow, items for members like t-shirts, etc.   
  
**Design a budget:**  
As explained in the module video, you don't really *need* anything to run workshops other than a laptop and a projector/large screen. Furthermore, I know that's true firsthand as that's what I did last year when I ran workshops. That being said, providing food and swag at workshops is a great incentive to get people to come, especially in the beginning of the year to attract people who haven't finalized their schedules with clubs yet. Free stuff (stickers, sunglasses, etc) are things we actually have an excess of, so swag for workshops isn't something we really need to factor into the budget. Therefore, the only thing we need for events is food.

  - **Food**: According to [this guide](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Timeline/4-Months-Before/Sponsorship/Draft-Your-Budget.html), the average cost for food for events is $7 per person per meal. Using that figure, and assuming 30 people per workshop (the average I got for last year), and assuming 2 events (workshop/networking/etc) a month throughout the school year (a total of 16 events), that gives us $7 \* 30 \* 16 = **$3360**.
  - **T-Shirts for Members**: The same guide says t-shirts cost $5-8 depending on volume. Current estimates for regular active members of MakeBU is around 30, which means the price of each shirt will be on the high end (CustomInk says $9, however we could likely do better). Using $8 a shirt and 30 members, that's **$240**.  
  
That gives a total of $3600. Another *nice to have* would be a buffer for unforeseen events. Setting a buffer of %10 would require another $360, bringing the total to **$3960**.
  
**Timeline**:  
The timeline for food would be to have enough for each event at least a week in advance so we could figure out catering options (at the very least there's Dominos, which doesn't really require any planning). The timeline for t-shirts doesn't really matter, as it's not really necessary for the club to function, so if we were able to order them at any time it would be great.

**Define your sponsorship tiers:**  
  - **15% / $594**: Sponsor gets logo on website and t-shirts.  
  - **30% / $1188**: Sponsor gets to host workshops of their choosing and is invited to networking events with students. (Bigger size logo than previous tier)  
  - **50% / $1980**: Sponsor is considered a partner of the club, can hold talks/workshops during hackdays/networking events. (Bigger size logo than previous tier)  
  
*Higher tiers include the benefits of lower tiers*
  
**Investigate the usability of your prospectus:**
  - *How quickly can a sponsor find the information they need?*
    - Sponsors can easily find what they'll get for their contribution from the sponsorship tiers. However, we plan on redesigning the MakeBU website soon, and part of that will include adding a page dedicated to sponsorship info, which will include background information in addition to the sponsorship tiers.
  - *What is the minimum amount of information needed to be useful?*
    - The minimum amount of information needed is some background on the club and events we do, as well as what a sponsor receives for their contribution.
  - *What kinds of sponsors need more background information?*  
    - Local companies who are sponsoring us but are not tech related might want extra information on what exactly they're paying for. Even technical sponsors might want more information on what exactly they'll get out of networking events.
