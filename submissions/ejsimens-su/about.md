Hi everyone!

My name is Emily, and I'm an incoming sophomore at Syracuse University. I'm in the School of Information Studies (iSchool) majoring in Information Management and Technology. 
Within my school, I participate in the Information Security Club, help run a tech overnight (IT Girls), and serve as a peer advisor.
Outside of the iSchool, I'm currently the Communications Vice President of Hillel at SU, which means I run the social media and marketing for the organization. 
I also work at my school's IT department as a student consultant. 

I would say my favorite emojis are the orange (because that's my school's mascot) and the girl typing on a computer! :)

So excited to meet everyone!
