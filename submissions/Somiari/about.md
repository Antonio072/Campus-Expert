### About Somiari 

Hello there! My name is Somiari Lucky and I am a final year Computer Science student of Rivers State University, Nigeria. 
When I'm not attempting Project Euler problems with Python, you will catch me writing front-end code or watching web dev tutorial videos. 
I play a lot of chess and listen to too much music. 

### Communities I am involved with

I recently started a dev community called [Developer Accent](https://twitter.com/DeveloperAccent) with some friends; and we plan 
to preach the Open Source Gospel while helping new developers learn faster and better. Prior to this, I was involved with a club 
called Mindgos (weekly meetups and code challenges)
