## Assessing IEEE's Needs

IEEE has been around at our university since 1947 and has seen varying states as an organization. Currently, I feel we are not serving the needs of the community we aim to serve because we have very low member retention. The new Electrical and Computer Engineering Building is opening this year and I hope having a unified space will help instill a sense of community to students within the department. To further foster the community we, as an organization, need to focus more on inclusion on a personal level at our meetings and events.  

### Definition
#### Current
- We are a student branch of the international organization, IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
- IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.
- Unfortunately, this definition is rather vague and is difficult to apply to our daily functioning.

#### Ideal
- We as students, encourage one another, mentor one another and share knowledge in the common pursuit of an Electrical and Computer Engineering Degree at the University of Texas.
- We are engaged with the professional chapter as well as deeply rooted in our university community.

#### How to Get There
- Expanding our membership will enhance the community, making our members feel more supported throughout their college experience
- Focus more on mentorship and personal connections among our members.

### Size
#### Current
- Each freshman is required to attend at least one of our meetings which artificially inflates our membership numbers
- We have about 30 truly active members that attend meetings and events consistently
- We have not real membership demographic numbers at all

#### Ideal
- We exist to serve anyone in the Electrical and Computer Engineering community at UT
- I'd like to see consistently 80 - 100 people at general meetings and 50 at our other more niche events

#### How to Get There
- Prove the value of our organizations through our general meetings that are required in order to retain all of the freshmen who are required to attend
- Record and analyze attendance at events and membership numbers

### Resources
#### Current
- We provide a lot of networking opportunities to our members through tech talks with companies
- We are an umbrella organization that connects people to our sub-societies which are more project focused

#### Ideal
- We are an outlet to connect older and younger members and foster mentorship
- We provide resources to help students succeed in their Electrical and Computer Engineering Degree

#### How to Get There
- Many of our members are younger, retaining older, more experienced members will allow us to foster more mentorship
- Plan meetings to be fun and inviting but also beneficial to attendees


### Accessibility
#### Current
- Our meetings are open to anyone of any major but primarily target ECE majors
- We meet on Thursday evenings during a time in which classes are not normally held and many businesses would be closed so people aren't at work
- We try to have content that freshmen can understand but also allow for Q&A so specific technical questions can be asked

#### Ideal
- Beyond being accessible, our meetings are truly inclusive
- People attending feel welcomed and leave with at least one connection

#### How to Get There
- This requires a culture shift. Starting with our officer team, we can intentionally include attendees and hopefully a ripple affect occurs where members welcome each other in the same open way

### Interests
#### Current
- Our community is primarily made up of ECE students, which I think is fine because we still have a lot of work to fully serve this group before we branch out to other groups
- ECE is a pretty broad degree so we serve students with interests in everything from power systems, to integrated circuits, to software
- We do function as a catch-all ECE organization and that can lead to a bit too broad of a focus for us

#### Ideal
- Serve anyone interested in technology
- Fully connect and serve the ECE student population
- Serve as a community that connects, supports, and encourages ECE students in their pursuit of a degree

#### How to Get There
- Start by broadening our reach within ECE
- ECE is becoming more and more dominated by software engineering, but not forgetting to serve the ECE majors with other interests
- Focus on mentorship and building connections within the organization

### Goals
#### Current
- Our members are mostly ECE degree seeking students, most of them are looking for internships and jobs to enhance their degree
- Younger members are also looking for support, guidance, and mentorship from older ECE students
#### Ideal
- Members become involved because they see the value in a strongly connected group with common interests
- Provide an outlet for sharing advice, experiences, and support
#### How to Get There
- Most of our events have a corporate partner there to speak about their company and what they do. This is a great way to get to know the industry, but it is important to have events that focus solely on our community as well.
- We've attempted a mentorship matching system but it was kind of a flop. I think focusing on organic mentorship will be much more successful.

### Location
#### Current
- We have an office space that has been in a portable building and now a gym shared with 5 other organizations since the ECE department has not had a building for the past 3 years
- We have been meeting in random campus spaces for the past 3 years
- We have serve food and water at our meetings
- Since the spaces have been fairly random the size and capabilities of the spaces has also varied based on what space we could get
#### Ideal
- We will have a dedicated office space in the new building so members always know where they can stop by to study, hang out, or ask questions
- This year our new building will be opening so hopefully we will be able to meet in the same space more consistently
- In the new space we can put more thought into making our meeting location more accessible
- Parking on campus is always tricky but street parking is usually free after 6 pm and our meetings are traditionally at 7 so that will help
#### How to Get There
- Moving into the new building will be a huge help
- This year will be extra important for setting things up and setting a standard for accessibility of our meetings and events

### Communication
#### Current
- We primarily use Facebook which is not great because it does not facilitate discussion
#### Ideal
- Emails for big announcements
- Slack team for member communication
- Github organization for open source projects
#### How to Get There
- We have a list of member e-mails it is just a matter of writing and sending announcements as Emails
- We have also recently created a slack channel for the officers. Now we need to add members and ensure that it remains active by encouraging conversations.

### Culture
#### Current
- We are extremely open by definition, however people don't always stick around perhaps because they don't feel welcome
- We do work closely with the ECE department so if there is an issue we have a pretty well defined chain of command to settle the dispute
#### Ideal
- Not just tolerant of new people and ideas, but welcoming of them
- People view IEEE as a haven for ECE students. Everyone is welcomed here and is made to feel important and valuable within our community.
#### How to Get There
- This requires a culture shift. Starting with the officer team and moving outwards seems like the best way to initiate the change.
- I want to set a goal for the team this year to meet and remember the name of at least one new person per event we host. I think this will go a long way towards creating an open and welcoming environment.
