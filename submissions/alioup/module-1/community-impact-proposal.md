## Summary of IEEE's Needs

The main issue facing our community is **member retention**. Every ECE student must attend at least one of our meetings, but many do not remain engaged. In order to better serve the community we need to provide value beyond the networking opportunities available at our meetings. Creating a community that **fosters mentorship and support** will better serve the community by personally connecting its members.

Currently the officer team is very close but we have very few engaged members. Meetings are more of a presentation and less of a conversation. It is my hope that we can shift to a **more inclusive model**, so that no one leaves one of our events without having made at least one connection. Communication currently is just announcements, not discussion. We need to create more opportunities for **personal connections**, but also create a platform for **fostering discussions**.


 Despite being a very old and established organization on our campus we have no real demographic metrics. Even our list of "members" does not truly reflect the engaged population. We really have a lot of work to do here before we can even measure the impact of our efforts.


## Your Proposal

**Goal:** Create a more engaged member base by fostering mentorship and support for one another. The other goals of our organization will be better served by accomplishing this.

**Steps to Take:**
- Use the opening of our new building as a key time to bring the Electrical and Computer Engineering community together in a **common space**.
- Start with the officer team being **intentionally inclusive** at our events. Encourage the team to talk to and remembering the name of at least one new person each time we have an event or meeting. Hopefully this example will carry on to the members as well.
- Put an emphasis on creating **personal connections** at meetings. Invite attendees to get to know one another through short activities and also make sure meetings are **fun and inviting**.
- Assess why we are hosting the events we do rather than fall into the established routine of years past. Make sure each event is **clearly motivated** and directly benefits our members.
- Reach out specifically to **new students** not only because they will benefit a lot from what we have to offer, but also because many members will be graduating this year.
- Create and maintain an **active and welcoming** slack channel that allows members to interact and discuss outside of scheduled events.
- Maintain office hours so members always **have a place** to come if they need support or just want a place to hang out.
- Record more **membership information** to better assess our efforts. Send out a **feedback survey** at the end of each semester to get member input.


## Your Proposal's Impact
- Target audience
  - Current members will benefit from more members and closer relationships among members
  - ECE students that are seeking mentorship and support in their studies will find it in our community
- Community needs
  - Currently we see huge drop off in our major. Having a better connected avenue for mentorship and other resources would encourage more students to stick with ECE.
  - The mission of the national IEEE organization is advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. By supporting students through their college journey we are ultimately enhancing the engineers that will advance technology.
- Resources
  - My proposal is primarily a culture shift and a change in the way we conduct our events so people and time are the primary resources.
  - Starting with our officer team we must mace our events more than accessible, we must make them inclusive.  
  - Falling into routine has hurt the quality of our events in the past so taking the time to make sure each event is re-assessed to maximize its potential impact.
- Media
  - As the school year begins and we move into the new building we will begin tweaking the way we operate.
  - Clear communication about when and exactly what our events entail will also be crucial for member retention.
- Content knowledge
  - I have a clear idea of the end result I'd like to see, but not total certainty about how to get there. I have ideas about what would make me feel included and supported but I know that is not the same for everyone.
  - Talking to other members about their experience with the organization and how we could be more welcoming and supportive will be helpful in determining the best methods.
- Timeline
  - Aug 28 - Officer Planning meeting
    - Ensure that officer team is on the same page about goals to enhance the inclusiveness of our community
  - Aug 30 - Welcome Week
    - Events to kick off the school year and get to know interested new members
    - Make sure every attendee makes a personal connection
  - Bi-Weekly meetings
    - Have fun contend in addition to company talk
    - Gather metrics about attendance
  - Dec - Assess progres
    - Review attendance and membership numbers
    - Assess why members have joined or left the group
  - Plan for Spring Semester will be updated after assessing Fall Semester progress.

## Planning for the Future

Seeing more engaged membership is hard to quantify but seeing that we are currently at a particularly low period any improvement would be a win. I think the best way to measure the success of this would be to look at the number of people who are invested in the future of the organization.

Once we have created a close knit community that fosters mentorship, it will be much easier to assess the communities needs. Currently I am trying to predict what people who are not involved would have wanted from our organization. In the future, assessing the group's needs would be as simple as asking and analyzing.

Since this is my last year, I hope that this goal of creating a more engaged member base can have real impact during this academic year. I think it is the perfect time to push for this change since it coincides with the opening of the new building. Net fall, the success of this initiative and the needs of the community should be re-assessed by the new community leaders.
