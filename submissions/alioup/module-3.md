# Explaining GitHub to Your Parents

My mom is a flight attendant and my dad is a veterinarian. They cheer me on in my pursuit of software engineering, but know very little about code much less version control systems. I brought home some octocat stickers from a hackathon and found myself trying to explain GitHub to them. Here's how I explained Github to people with no software background.

## Software Development Process Issues
- It's very easy to mess things up. You can only press the undo button so many times. What now?
- Working with other people only complicates the issue. How can you all work on things at the same time?
- Software is very collaborative. How do you share your code and make sure others can access it?

## Why Version Control Helps
- Save a history of your changes - Commits
  - Rather than keeping a new copy of files every time they change, just keep track of what is different.
- Work on two different copies of the project - Branches
  - Two different people (or even the same person) can make a copy of the project to work on things independently, when they are finished it can be re-combined to the original project.
- Share your project - Repositories
  - This is what we call projects and GitHub hosts these repositories online so sharing your code is as simple as sending someone a link to the project.

## What this would be like for them
-  Commits - Ingredients in a cake
  - Imagine you are baking a cake and you add each ingredient, that would be like adding a commit.
  - You can look at the history of all the things you added, but let's say the cake is all mixed together and you realize someone is allergic to chocolate. You would be able to just remove the chocolate without re-making the entire cake.
  - With code, if you realize later that a feature isn't going to work is is really easy to remove the parts you don't want without re-doing a lot of work.
- Branches - Making a dress as a team
  - Everyone would have a copy of the pattern that was the same in order to make their part successfully.
  - Each person can take a copy of the pattern and when they are done with their part (let's say they made the left sleeve) they would bring it back and add it to the final dress.
  - If you started making the left sleeve and the person making the skirt finished before you it wouldn't matter because when you showed up with your sleeve if would fit since you both worked off of the same pattern.
  - If the team decided later to add ruffles to the sleeves, you could copy all of the work that was already done, just make the ruffles and add them to the original dress.
  - This does get dicey if two people are working on the same part of the dress (or software project) then when they try to combine their work you have to manually decide which piece to use.
- Repository - Graffiti wall
  - You can tell someone the location of a wall of graffiti. If they want to take a look, they can come there to check it out.
  - You can also bring your own spray paint and add to the wall!
  - Hosting a repository on GitHub is kind of like that. You can tell people, really easily, where they can find your project and (if you want them to) they can also add and contribute to it.
