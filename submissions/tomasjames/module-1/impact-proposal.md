## Summary of the Community's Needs

- **Community demographics**:  
    The group would comprise, at least initially, of solely physics students at UCL. They would be students that have an interest in technology and want to learn more, be it for enjoyment or to help them streamline their coding techniques to use during their degree. The group would be accessible to around 80-100 people, though perhaps only 20% of these would attend. Attendees would all be educated to at least A-Level, and have backgrounds in mathematics and physics. Currently the resources accessible to them are all University centric: primarily module organisers and staff that run occassional clinics. These are accessible to the community.

- **Communication**:  
    It goes without saying that Facebook is ubiquitous amongst us, however I feel it important for community members to begin getting to grips with version control as soon as possible. As a result, initially email and Facebook would be used to communicate and share ideas, but we would transition over to a GitHub Organisation soon after project commencement to better utilise it as a platform that is aligned to our interest.
- **Culture**:  
    Our culture would be open to all physicists, at least initially (we hope to grow to be able to encompass other disciplines in due course as well). Our goal is to nurture a love of coding and share skills and ideas amongst like minded scientists, be they controversial or not. We're keen to hear every side of everybody's coding experiences, be they good or bad. We also want to encourage people who dislike coding to come along to potentially a foster a new hobby!


## Your Proposal  

Throughout my undergraduate degree I found it difficult to find expert technological help suited to physicists and the problems we face. We aren’t computer scientists, but we make heavy use of code to complete data reduction, simulations and everything in between. The problem is, our code isn’t good code: it completes a task, but it doesn’t necessarily do it efficiently, or in line with best practices. 

I want to set up a support group to help teach physicists about tools outside those directly taught in degrees. Things like using Docker to containerise your development environments, using GitHub to version control (and then present) your work, and about not being afraid to try new things if they’ll make your coding life easier. Also I want to champion Open Source Software!

- **Timing**:  
    We aim to organise monthly meetings initially to test the waters, potentially increasing this to bi-monthly should demand dictate it. We also aim to run regular open office hours (perhaps once a week for an afternoon) to assist with general coding queries.
- **Community demographics**:  
    Our goal isn't to initially increase the size of the community. Instead, it is to set it up successfully and regularly. We aim to begin this at the start of the Autumn 2017 Semester when students have just returned from their summer break. The advantage of this is twofold: firstly, a new cohort of undergraduates is arriving for their first year. Secondly, those students that are returning will likely have picked up skills throughout their Summer break, which they can then share with the community.
- **Goals**:  
    Our goals are:
    - Share niche skills that can help one another in our work lives, our hobby lives and everywhere in between
    - Allow members to bolster their CVs with these new skills
    - Help members learn better coding practicses
    - Show a tech-minded community what tech can do for them, thus opening up their enjoyment even further
    - Having fun, and allowing people to do what they enjoy!
- **Communication**:  
    Initially communication would be via standard monthly (or bi-monthly) meetups, with regular email updates in between. In terms of inter-community communication, the prevalence of Facebook makes it an ideal choice. We would, however, encourage the transition over to a GitHub Community fairly soon.


## Your Proposal's Impact


- Target audience
  - We're looking to target physicists who want to learn more about technology, but don't quite know how or are too scared too because of the time investment required.
- Community needs
  - What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?  
    - We want our community to enjoy coding and tech and not see it as a chore, or just a requirement of their degree.
- Resources
  - What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?  
    - A meeting space that is regular and consistent in location as well as size
    - Consistent access to projectors, whiteboards or space to present work
    - As the community grows, potentially more volunteers to help the group  
  - How will you obtain those resources?   
    - Through request to the University and research to find the best option available  
    - We will also pool existing students to see whether any of them would like to volunteer to assist  
- Media  
  - How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?  
    - Presentation facilities are required, but the overall feel would be informal meetups that are largely set-up and go; we want the barrier to entry to be as low as possible.  
    - Our vision is to set a relevant task for the session (for example, download and set up a Docker environment for Python development). This would be delivered via slideshow, with breaks in between to allow members to digest information and implement what they've learned before moving on to the next step.  
  - What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?  
    - Set up slideshows in advance and ensure that the content is achievable within the timeframe we have for the meetings.  
- Content knowledge  
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?  
    - Having worked as a software developer prior to my degree I am now far more familiar with development than when I left University. There are multiple things that I now know that would have made my coding challenges during my degree far more straightforward. I want to impart this knowledge to other physicists.  
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?  
    - I am familiar with extracting information from technical documentation, something that is a requirement of a good developer. I have given technical talks at conferences in the past, so I have everything I would need to conduct such an event. I would, however, require assistance in honing these skills even further.  
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.  
    - Meetings would be once a month initially, with regular email and Facebook updates in between.  
    - We would look at more meetings should demand need it.
    - Similarly we would look at open office hours to ask for assistance on technnical matters.  
  - If you are presenting content, identify the timing of your presentation.  
    - We would allocate 1.5 hours for the meetings, where roughly half of that is presentation and the other half is hands on coding.

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?  
    - Our intention is to monitor engagement at every event and track these over time. 
    - Feedback is also important and we would set up a poll after every session to anonymously give this feedback.
    - These would then be collated every 6 months and another impact-proposal and community-assessment compiled.
- How will you measure success?
    - This will be done via a combination of attendance numbers and feedback.
    - Should both indicate consistent (or increasing) attendance and feedback, then we would deem that successful. However the largest measure of success would come from the feedback itself, as attendance isn't directly corrolated to enjoyment or success.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
    - We would look in to this twice a year (i.e. every 6 months), but should changes not need to be made then they will not be made for the sake of it.
