### Definition
- How would you define your community?  
    I'd define the community as a group of physicists (be they vanilla physicists, astronomers or anywhere in between) that want to learn more about tech tools, development practices and ideals that will help assist them in the work they do during (and hopefully after) their degree.

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?  
    This number is ever changing, and isn't as straightforward as just the number of enrolled physics students. The group itself would largely comprise of 3rd and 4th year undergraduates doing their projects, as well as a few postgraduates and students from years 1 and 2 (though these would only number a handful, at most). This equates to a pool of around 80-100 people.
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?  
    I'd like it to grow with time and increase in number up to a maximum of 150 people. To be frank however so long as the number attending remains manageable, I'm happy!
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?  
    The group is currently uninitiated, so as of 31/08/2017 this question cannot be answered definitively. That being said, I would imagine that the group remains roughly consistent, year-to-year, in terms of its size. Whilst the number of 'candidates' (i.e. students enrolled on a physics degree) doesn't change much year-to-year, the number of students that require the help of the community may change. As such the group could grow or shrink on a yearly basis.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?  
    There are taught modules throughout our degree, but not many student run communities to tackle the exact problems that physics students face. There are also societies, but they seem to focus on computer science students rather than physicists.
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?  
    Currently, module organisers have open office hours but that is related to the module that they organise. This is where the community would take over. We would initially start out with meetups and then expand (potentially) from there depending on the natural direction that the community takes, within reason. 

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?  
    Currently, they're very accessible. Should a student need help, it is there. That being said, that assistance focuses on material directly covered in the course. Should a student want to learn about Docker and how it can improve a development workflow, for example, then that would largely comprise online resources in a self taught manner. 
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?  
    The hours of the University are usually 9-5, though help is available informally between 9-6. 
- Is there childcare available?  
    Indirectly: the University has childcare services though this would not be affiliated with the community directly. Any attendees that require childcare would need to make arrangements themselves.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?  
    Far from it: we would all be physicists of one form of another.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?  
    Initially I think it wise to focus on a specific demographic and then should the material within the community be of use to other groups/degree courses, then this can be investigated in future. Ultimately we want to be an inclusive community, but also be one that is not self-destructive in taking on too much in too short a time. This also rings true for topics.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?  
    Initially, to learn. Physicists are natural problem solvers and so in a way setting up a community to solve a problem is a very physicist thing to do! More broadly however I believe this community would allow people to bolster their CVs with new skills, as well as helping them learn better coding practicses. This can then be used to focus more time on learning physics, or conversely to begin a new hobby.
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?  
    They are indeed.
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?  
    A portion of the community demographic would be, yes.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?  
    This would likely be a mixture of yes and no: some students may use the group as a means to try a new hobby, whilst others have already developed passionately and are keen to do more.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?  
    Firstly, to set it up. Secondly, to schedule regular meetings and have regular attendees, with some either giving talks on skills they've learned or code meetups over coffee. Thirdly, seek feedback on whether the community and sessions are enjoyable: if so, how so and if not, why not? As an organiser I cannot be precious or jaded: the community exists for its members and it must change according to their needs.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?  
    Currently it does not have a meeting place as it is still in the meeting stages. However the University has extensive space and meeting areas that could be utilised.
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?  
    It would span both online and offline, likely via a GitHub community.
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?  
    There is parking, but the intended demographic would likely not use it.
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?  
    Central London has excellent public transport links, so yes.
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?  
    We would endeavour to ensure that it is, though arrangements may require that it is only accessible to UCL students.
- How much does it cost to use the space?  
    Providing it is for UCL students only, then it is free. Should we need to seek alternative meeting space then cost would be investigated.
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?  
    Most spaces have access to tables, chairs and projectors as well as whiteboards and powersockets. Table configurations can be moved, and for our use this is perfect.
- How many people can it fit?  
    We would ensure that the space is large enough to fit the expected number of attendees. Should it grow, then the space will grow with it.
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?  
    Seating is standard table and chairs, and it can accomodate most shapes and sizes. Should this not be the case we can work towards a solution.
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?  
    We can arrange something along these lines. Depending on venue, this could be catered or a local restaurant or snack bar.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?    
    Initially I think a mailing list would be great. Attendees would be free to add each other on Facebook, follow each other Twitter, Instagram and GitHub etc.
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?  
    We would set up an email group and GitHub organization, as well as potentially a Facebook group. GitHub organisation would be the primary means of contact, seconded by email.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?  
    The only spanner here would be that the vast majority of people are familiar with Facebook, so this could evolve in to the primary means of contact.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?  
    We would make the community a bastion of inclusivity - we want everybody to feel comfortable in themselves, as well as sharing their ideas. No idea is wrong, it just may not be best suited to the task at hand.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?  
    It would depend on the disagreement. Should it be amicable, it would be wise to encourage both parties to see the other party's argument and empathise accordingly. Hopefully this would allow them to reach a common middleground. Should it not be amicable then further investigation would be required, including reporting it to the University as it would likely breach their Code of Conduct requiring formal action.
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?  
    These would be drawn up on commencement of the project, but they would outline inclusivity and fairness.
- How will you personally handle it?  
    Every new attendee would recieve a copy. Attendance would be taken as agreement to be bound by said policies and procedures.
