# Greetings!

I'm Tom. I'm a PhD student in Astrophysics at University College London in London, England. 

Prior to my PhD, I was a professional software developer at a small agency. A specific high point of this career was being lucky enough to be selected to attend GitHub Satellite 2017 on a Scholarship (spoiler alert: it was great!).

I'm always excited to try new tools, languages and frameworks and for me GitHub underpins all of that: it's the stability that a transient learning adventure needs! This is especially true during the development of my PhD where I hope to include CI (TravisCI) and Virtual Environments (Docker) in the development workflow.

Outside of academia I'm a keen motorsport enthusiast. I also love video games, and should read more than I do.
