## Usability of prospectus
Every company in Baja have a lack of programmers or tech people so events like talks, hackathons or workshops are important to them. They're a powerful tool to
share what their company does, whay they need and even hire someone instanlty!
My sponsorship levels are a powerful tool to the companies so people get to know them quickly, those tiers listed above are the ones I've implemented in the past
(I organize events as part of Google Developer Group Member Tijuana) and all our sponsors are happy about the benefits and the results of getting adversited at our events.
