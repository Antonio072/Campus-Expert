#Community ( Defcon 664 )
Defcon 664 is a small community here in Tijuana Mexico where people enjoy sharing their experience with others about cyber security. They have reunions once a month with no more than 4 talks or in it's case workshops gaining popularity among the developer community because of their interesting and fun talks.

Back when I was starting as an Engineer student I remember going to a reunion by them where they explain what it is & how to enter the deepweeb and it was really fun, we enter several url's, see a black market and more. 
The community right now is starting again because their founder back in 2009 was hired by a US company so there was no one who had the ability to manage the group.

##Nature of incident
Remember a few months back when they were starting again there was a huge problem because there was a person who was spamming all over the new group about a non-related job vacant and credit card offer. Few persons make the owner of the group know about that persons that it was not cool that there was a person doing that.

##Moderation action
The leader of the group talked to the person and explained the purpose of the group to make the person saw by his own choice that it was the wrong group to publish that kind of announcements.

##Outcome
The person stopped publishing his ads and instead, he joined the community even he was not a geeky person.

##What could be different?
Maybe it was a lot easier to make that as a rule  "no spamming of non relate things" and the person who broke that then it would be kicked out.

#My community ( GDG Tijuana )
I'm part of an awesome community called Google Developer Group Tijuana where we have monthly reunions at startups or companies. Out biggest event was Google IO extended 15 where we had 150 attendees and over 10 activities all day long.
Our mission is to share with others our experience about using and working with Google technologies such as Firebase, Polymer, etc. We're a 9 year old community.

##Nature of incident
There was a group of persons back in 2010 who said they were part of the GDG community, making events and collecting money with them ( we NEVER collect money from our events ).

##Moderation action
We talked with them, make them know that it was not correct to do that. Out community was always free for the people and if they want to collect money they should start their own community.

##Outcome
The persons were sorry about their actions and made us know that it was the last that they do that.

##What could be different?
Maybe offer them to work with us because they had the iniciative to make avents.
