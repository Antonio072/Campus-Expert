# Community ( Defcon 664 )
Starting I'm going to talk about Defcon 664, a small community here in Tijuana Mexico where people enjoy sharing their experience with others about cyber security. They have reunions once a month with no more than 4 talks or in it's case workshops gaining popularity among the developer community because of their interesting and fun talks.

Back when I was starting as an Engineer student I remember going to a reunion by them where they explain what it is & how to enter the deepweeb and it was really fun, we enter several url's, see a black market and more. 
The community right now is starting again because their founder back in 2009 was hired by a US company so there was no one who had the ability to manage the group.

## Nature of the incident
I remember a few months back when they were starting again, it was a huge problem because there was a person who was spamming all over the new group about a non-related job vacant and a credit card offer. Few persons talked to the owner of the group about it and conclude that it was not the purpose of the group so ->

## Moderation action
-> the leader of the group talked to the person and explained the meaning of the group to make the person see by his own choice that it was the wrong group to publish that kind of announcements.

## Outcome
Few days after, the person stopped publishing his ads and instead he joined the community even he was not a geeky person.

## What could be different?
Some people said that it was a lot easier to make "no spamming of non relate things" a rule and the person who broke it would be kicked out.

## My community ( GDG Tijuana )
I'm part of an awesome community called Google Developer Group Tijuana where we have monthly reunions at startups or companies. Out biggest event was Google IO extended 15 where we had 150 attendees and over 10 activities all day long.
Our mission is to share with others our experience about using and working with Google technologies such as Firebase, Polymer, etc. We're a 9 year old community and I remember a a few years back 

## Nature of incident
there was a group of people who said they were part of the GDG community, making events and collecting money from them ( we NEVER collect money from our events ). 

## Moderation action
So we investigate about who was running the "community" and when we found "the team" we talked with them, make them know that it was wrong to do that because our community was always free for everyone and if they want to collect money they should start their own community.
When we said that to the persons running the fake community 

## Outcome
they were sorry about their actions and made us know that it was the last time they do that. If they didn' accept it 

## What could be different?
maybe offer them to work with us because they had the iniciative to make avents.
