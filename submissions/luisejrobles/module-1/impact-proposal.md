# Community Impact Proposal

## Summary of the Community's Needs
### Demographics:
As I said on my assessment, in Tijuana we have one of the fastest growing tech/dev communitys in Mexico as a lot of international companies are starting to land here because of the talent.
We have monthly meetups with different communities with more than 40 persons mostly developers but some students shows up (around 70-30), as a tech community attendant I've seen that is a male dominated one but in recent meetings I've seen them more diverse as more womens are attending. My target is students and programmers who are interested in creating a more unified tech community. Our resources would be the ones that we have now plus some new from our new sponsors like:
* Sonata Services
* Thermofisher Scientific
* Advancio
* Jelp App
* Arkus Nexus

#### Communication:
Our official channels for communicating between us would be:
* Facebook Group.
* Hangouts (Video Calling).
* Github repos
* Slack
* Email newsletter (mid-term implementation)

### Culture:
Our culture here in Baja, specially in Tijuana is a hardworking one always innovating as in recent years it's been a boom in the tech industry. Many of the schools and companies in our state are taking very serious the need of innovation and technology in startups making them implement groups of study, incubators and mentors to shape people's projects.

## My Proposal
My goal is to make engineering students and enthusiasts understand the value of technology and the opportunity we have to always stay up to date, getting experience by helping others and to be proactive. The way I want to achieve that it's by doing:
* Meetups every 2 weeks.
* Getting open source projects for non-lucrative organizations.
* Organizing meetings with tech companies in out state so they can teach us what they're doing.
* Organizing a Hacathon per year so people can go and show us they talent and push themselves to create new things.

All the events and related topics about the community we're going to resolve them using:
* Facebook Groups.
* Hangouts.

All of the media generated for the community will be made and shared by our social networks to inform the people what we're achieving.
I have in my possession a lot of knowledge resources as bootcamps, courses, workshops and monthly communities events. As I said before, the tech community in Tijuana is very active in that way so we'll have a lot of options to stay updated and being prepared for what we'll build.
### Timeline:
* First meeting
   * Explaining what's the purpose of the group.
   * Give them our official communication channels.
   * Setting up our rules.
* Organizing our first meetup.
   * Select place.
   * Select topic.
   * Select hour.
   * Talk about prospect projects.
* Organizing our first talk for the community.
   * Gather all the resources to achieve it.
   * Organize our team.
That three activies are the first one to do since we're going to be in early stage of organization we'll have more with time,our first meeting will be in October 30th so we can start splitting duties.

## Our future
Our success will be measured by the number of persons at our talks, our open source projects to help resolve problems and out ability and empathy for helping each other at the community.
