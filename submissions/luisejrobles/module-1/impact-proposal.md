My proposal as a student, Google Developer Group member and Google Certified Educator lvl 1 is:
-Have talks at my campus (two in a month), where real companies share their experience about hiring new devs, their current technologies and what languages are using the most.
-Talk with the director of my faculty to make a plan about making "Proyectos UABC" bigger so more students have the opportunity to collaborate and work in real projects.
-Make a hackathon (1 or twice a year) where students have the opportunity to share with other students, create and have fun as developers.
-Have lightning reunions once every two weeks where students talk about new languages that they are learning or share some problems they have with their homeworks.

I thinks it's a little but powerful list of things, it's the start and it's going to be hard but I think as a community we're ready to be united and have some great time around code!.
