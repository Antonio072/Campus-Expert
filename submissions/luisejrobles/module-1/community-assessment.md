# Community Assessment
### Shaping the community

## Defining the community
Our community would be by and for programmers but also for tech enthusiasts who wants to do great things no matter gender or ideology, everyone would be accepted. Our goal is to create a community of people who has the iniciative to transform and help our city organizing or crearting events and open source projects for non-lucrative organizations and internal projects. People with begginer to advanced programming skills are welcome but also tech enthusiasts.

## Size
At first instance we're going to be 5 students until we get to organize ourselves but as time pass we will be accepting more members to increase our projects and making our events and meetings better.

## Resources
I have experience with tech communities, online tools, seminars where I live since I've been in the Google Developer Group Tijuana for 5 years straight. As GDG i'm in charge of organizing monthly meetings at different companies and 2 big events a year, the first it's called "Google IO #Extended" where usually we do a live transmission of the Google IO event that Google makes to launch products and updates about their technology. The second one is called "Devfest" and usually it's an all day long event where we setup talks, workshops and a hackathon where tech people can prove their skills by doing amazing projects in 12 hours.
As a major community, every 3 months all the tech  communities here in Tijuana (python community, GDG, js, .net, UX Players, defcon 6664) we organize an all day long event called "Intercomunidades" where every community have 1 hour to setup talks, workshops or just a meetup.
At "intercomunidades" we have the support of tech companies like Thermofisher, Sonata Services, Advancio, Arte Digital. Usually they give us food, money or swag to support our event and make it even better.

## Accessibility
Our resources as a community will be at a Facebook Group and a hangouts group where everyone who wants can access the information they want like courses, events, tools, certifications and more. Our meetings will be maybe friday after work hours or saturdays depending how we organize ourselves, if it's a minor update of how are things going maybe we can use hangouts but if it's something relevant it's important to have a discussion in person.
Every detail about our meetings will be at our Facebook group as a quick update file after meetings so if someone can't attend they can check the file to be up to date.

## Location
Our first meetings will be at my school, I talked with a professor 3 days ago and he offer me to  a classroom to make our meetings. After we have some time and the community grows I plan to make our meetings maybe once every two months at a company office to interact with real tech workers and see what's in the industry alongside a "local" meeting at coffee shops, brewing bars or at school every two weeks.

## Communication
Our officials channels will be:
* Facebook Group.
* Github Repo (for projects and administration  )
* Slack (for projects).
* Hangouts (video calling).
* Email newsletter (mid-term implementation)

## Culture
Our community will be open to anyone no matter what but with the condition to treat everyone  with respect. If someone's treating someone with disrespect we'll take action and talk to the one that it's offending because we'll not tolerate that kind of behavior.
As a community we'll be open to new ideas, opinions and every suggestion because it's what makes us so diverse and creative as humans.
