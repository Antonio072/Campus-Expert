# The compromises of education without Technology
How many times do you have awesome ideas but you don't have the tools to implement them? How
many times do you see a student helping a teacher with technology? Those are two of many
problems we see at schools, older people specially teachers need to be up to date.
They need to have the iniciative to learn something diferent even if it's scary for them, algo the courage to invest some of their free time to stay updated.

We're going to have a journey through diferent stages of education until we arrive into our days, we're going to see different type of tools and technology that makee the teacher's life easier until we get to our days. 
In this talk we'll learn about Google Apps for education and how they can help us achieve whatever we want to create, tools that will help us engage more with our students by giving them the power to shape their classes with their creativity. So if you want to join us, this if for you teacher, you that have the iniciative to create engaging classes, you the one that put your students first and maybe a little afraid to learn somethin new but you know.. nothing's impossible.
