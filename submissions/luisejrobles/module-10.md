# Tech Players (Club Proposal)
The mission is to help undergraduate people get into the industry technology by offering them regularly talks, meetups and updates about the projects once every two weeks. The text above describes also our values and vision:

We'll be a supportive, comprehensive and a inclusive group ruled by a code of conduct where we can put everything we consider that helps our communication and convivence, we'll be a group where everyone feels comfortable to share their ideas of projects without fearing of being rejected or not heared. We'll try to be supportive for non-skilled persons and if they want to know where to start learning we'll provide them the basics in this industry sharing with them our resources as courses, blogspots, newsletter for example Coursera courses, Medium posts, Codecademy and sites where they can learn what they want.

## Benefits:
- Learn what technologies are using companies and implement them in out projects so we stay updated.
- See what others are doing to be successful in out area.
- Help others with their code problems.
- We'll try to have companies in out meetings to see what tech are they using but also they favorite tools.

## Activities
- All the team members will be encouraged to develop one or two open source projects annually to foundations that have a necessity or a problem so they will help them with their developer/tech skills. Maybe we can thank them by giving them treats like stickers or swag from our sponsors that I talked in another module.

## Getting our projects
As we know as dev our skills regularly aren't communication with others or getting a deal, so first we need to train a little group to get the projects, this team will be the one in charge of getting us our open source projects explaining to the organizations our purpose to help them with the thing we like the most to do.
We'll explain our "clients" how we work (agile methodologies or another) so they understand what it's going.

Some of the things I explained above I think the campus at my school fails to fix, they're so into their classes so they don't have the time to implement something like my proposal.
The plan is to grow into an open source dev community not only on my campus but in the city having weekly meetings, webinars, and why not? hackathons too to have some fresh ideas about projects we can develop. To achieve that I plan to make a Fb Group and a Page for the Club to be accessible for everyone.

We'll communicate with each other with respect, taking care each other because in the end we'll be peers at this global growing industry. So in case theres a disagreement we'll talk about it and resolve for the best.

## Future plan (growing)
The plan is as we conclude a few open source projects, reach younger programmers at school so they can learn at a younger age with the support of the ones that have experience in projects. Also we're going to open our club so everyone who wants to apport to the projects or join us helping us can make it (with an interview first of a previous meeting explaining them the purpose of the group).

## Fixing conflicts
As a students group I know there will be a few problems, as communication, maybe disagreements about persons, projects or ideas so we'll be ruled by a code of conduct that we'll be making in our first meetings as it's important to have one. Everyone will be writing every rule they consider is good for communication in the community, later we'll be voting the ones we consider that needs to be in there but everytime we'll approach every problem the most human way possible through talking, listening and understanding the necessity of the affected one.
