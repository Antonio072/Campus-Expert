Tech players

The mission is to help undergraduate people get into the industry technology by offering them regularly talks and reunions once every two weeks.

Activities & Benefits:

-Learn what technologies are using companies.

-See what others are doing to be a successful dev.

-Help others with their code problems.

-We'll try to have companies every meeting to see what are the tech they are using.

The points above are the ones I think the campus at my school fails to fix, they're so into their classes so they don't have the time to implement something like my  proposal.
The plan is to grow into a dev community not only on my campus but in the city having weekly meetings, webinars, and why not? hackathons too. To achieve that I plan to make a Fb Group and a Page for the Club to be accessible for everyone.

We'll communicate with each other with respect, taking care each other because in the end we'll be peers at this global growing industry. So in case theres a disagreement we'll talk about it and resolve for the best.
