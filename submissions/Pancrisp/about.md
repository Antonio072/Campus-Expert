## Tell us a little bit about yourself ##

Hello there everyone! 

My name's **Ervin**, a sophomore software engineering student at RMIT University in Melbourne. 
I run/organise workshops for the programming club and am the secretary for the CS department's student community.
I'm also an undergrad tutor (*some call us TAs*) for our school.

Beyond that, I'm a regular participant, speaker and organiser at several meetups in our local tech community, 
especially ones that champion junior, graduate and career-switching developers.

Also probably full stack, definitely front end.

### Other interests outside of tech ###
- I like to cook, I take pride in what I make in the kitchen. The dream housemate they say, but alas, I live alone...
- An avid writer, though I disappointed my high school English teacher (she was amazing) for not pursuing writing as a professional career, 
I also never finished a short story I started in my penultimate year. Double whammy.
- Being Dr Windy, my wannabe counselor persona.  People seem to trust me with a lot of their personal issues. 
No one should ever have to say *"...people don't listen to me and my problems anymore"*

### What's your favourite emoji? ###
- :+1: - *What you want to see in your PRs*
- :shit: - *What you say about your colleagues when they reject your PRs*
- :eyes: - *How I look like when pair programming*
- :pray: :boom: :fire: - *Friday push to prod*
- :hourglass: - *npm install, though it's gotten a lot better since npm ^5.0*
