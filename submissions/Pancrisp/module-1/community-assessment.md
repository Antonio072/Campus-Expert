# The student community at RMIT University #

## Definition ##

**Current**

At its core, our club acts as an intermediary between our students and the industry as a whole. We provide students a platform for connecting with the thriving tech community. A lot of this is done in preparation of securing either a graduate role or a part-time position on the side while completing their tertiary studies.

**Ideal**

Through our extensive network with the local startup community and other established tech companies, we hope that by forging a close working relationship with the tech industry, both parties will stand a chance of gaining a mutual benefit:

Students - *acquire the necessary skills to be improve employability*

Industry - *hire graduates who can hit the ground running on day one*

and avoid things like:
> *"Universities do not produce graduates equipped with the skills that accurately reflect the industry's needs."*

> *"Forget everything you've learned at uni, we're going to re-train you from the ground up."*

Those are the exact words I've heard from engineering team leads and hiring managers.
That's not something students want to hear when they've sank a fortune into their education.

## Size ##

**Current**

We currently have just over 100 registered members.

In the past, the club's leadership committee has always had difficulty passing the torch to first or second year students. The club would then remain dormant for a couple years before someone picks it up again. We lose a lot of our members and part of the club's identity each time this happens. So that's something we're trying to improve in the coming years, by bringing in more first and second year students and giving them the opportunity to take on leadership roles.

**Ideal**

While I can't speak for the entire club, I think it's safe to assume that most of us aren't too concerned about the number of people we have in our community, we'd much rather see increased levels of engagement among our existing members. This has always been an issue for us - we generally tend to see a solid turnout of 30 to 40 people in club activities during the first few weeks of the semester, it then slowly tapers off as the semester progresses.

Student retention is what we're gunning for!

## Resources ##

**Current**

We run several kinds of events throughout the year.
- Hackathons (once per semester)
- Recruitment campaigns by industry partners (varies every semester)
- Social Nights (twice per semester, beginning & end of semester)
- Meetups (weekly, there's heaps in Melbourne and we pick an interesting one to promote every week)
- General club meetings (weekly, catchup session - no agenda, just rock up and talk about anything tech/non-tech for 2 hours)

**Ideal**

In the past, we've had companies approach us about organising talks and recruitment campaigns, though these aren't a common occurence. In most cases, we would get about two or three events like these throughout each semester. We would like to have more skills based workshops/talks organised for our community. Based on feedback we've received last semester, there's quite a fair bit of interest in the latest  web technologies. So that's definitely something we have lined up in the coming months.

The club is also working towards creating a safe learning environment where students feel comfortable sharing their own personal projects with others. We have a large club project that everyone works on but what we'd really like to see at the micro level is for students to have the their own projects that they're working on, either by themselves or with others in the club.

## Accessibility ##

**Current**

All our hosted events are open to the public, this can include students from any other discipline.
Our weekly meetings are held every Monday evening from 6pm to 8pm.

**Ideal**

I would really like to see a more diverse group of people getting involved in our club activities. As it is right now, most of our members are CS students. While there's nothing inherently wrong with that, our industry relies on the help of so many people from other disciplines, it would be nice to see more of such people getting involved in our activities.

I've recently been talking to the Communication Design Association to see if they're open to any kind of collaboration in the future.

## Interests ##

**Current**

As our club consists of mostly computer science students. The club's interests are in technical topics within the field of computer science like algorithms, data structures, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and other really advanced topics. We would talk about different topics each week and then spend an hour or two working together on several interesting problems that are specific to the topic of the week.

**Ideal**

Like I've mentioned earlier, while we have nothing against the majority of our members being computer science students, it wouldn't hurt to have more diversified interests among the club members.
We are trying to tackle this by collaborating with other clubs on campus.

## Goals ##

**Current**

Having spoken to a lot of our members over the past couple years, most join us with the intention of seeking like-minded individuals who share a common interest, and through that hope to learn something from one another. Students also come to us looking for future employment opportunities as the club's brand is heavily promoted alongside many companies who run their recruitment campaigns on campus.

**Ideal**

There's still some room for improvement though. We can learn how to better accommodate our members' ineterests when it comes to club activities. When we planned this year's roadmap for club activities, most of the activites were based on what was interesting to the leadership committee. Our members weren't given the opportunity to decide on the kind of activities that would take place throughout the year. We can also work on improving how we keep students informed of industry events on campus throughout the year. From what we've seen, a lot of these events go unnoticed by most first and second year students, presumably because they think it's still too early for them to be shopping around for a graduate position. We're hoping to change this mindset and show how it can be beneficial to engage with local tech companies at events like these.

## Location ##

**Current**

We host most of our events and meetings at university. There's plenty of dedicated event rooms for club-related activities across campus so we tend to stick to those when running our events. It's in a nice central location (campus is in the city) whereby even working postgrads would find it convenient to participate in our events.

The only exception would be the weekly meetups that we advertise. In this case, all club members who are attending would gather wherever the meetup is hosted.

**Ideal**

I would say the only challenge we have right now is finding a dedicated space for all our club. Currently, we're required to book the event roms through the university every time we host club activities. It would be ideal to have all our activities running in the same space every time. We tend to see more consistent participation rates when we organise activities in the same space. It would also be a lot easier on the organising committee.

## Communication ##

**Current**

Leadership committee communicates through Slack and we have most of our management tasks on Trello.

With regards to how we engage with our members, initially we tried using Slack as our main means of keeping in touch with them. However, we soon discovered it wasn't really going to work out because getting students to adopt Slack was REALLY HARD when most of them have no experience with it whatsoever.

Slack and Git, the bane of every CS student.

**Ideal**

Stick to social platforms that members are familiar with - Facebook pages/groups.

## Culture ##

Aw man, this is a big one for me personally. It's one that I'm working so hard on improving within the club.

I find this to be the most important aspect of the entire assessment.

**Current**

Truth be told, I'm not too happy with the club's current approach of handling members of varying levels of technical knowledge and experience. I believe it's the reason why not many of our members stick around for more than a couple months. Our membership numbers have pretty much stagnated over the past couple of years as a result.

There's also a strong tendency of using overly-sophisticated tech stacks for a lot of our internal projects. We run the risk of ostracising a lot of our newer, less experienced members with this approach.

We have a group of brilliant students in the committee, each very accomplished in their respective field of interests. However, there's an unfortunate divergence of opinion on how the club should be run - with a majority leaning towards catering to people with advanced or very specific interests.

**Ideal**

My hope is that as a club, we can be more open to people with different levels of experience and interests by dedicating more resources to organising activities that brings together all types of people.

At the end of the day, I personally think the committee needs to come together and agree on the purpose and vision of the club. Having diverging ideals is like a constant tug o' war battle that takes up so much of our time when we should be focusing on improving our members' learning experience in the club.
