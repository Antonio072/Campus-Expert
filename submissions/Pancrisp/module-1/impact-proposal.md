## The community's needs

The following would be a summary of what was outlined in the community assessment.

- **Better industry engagement**: As a technical university that favours an applied approach towards a lot of our courses, hiring companies like engaging with the student community here in hopes of finding the best talent for their graduate programs. I think there's room for improvement in how we manage our relationships with industry partners, any benefits we gain will get passed on to students.

- **Knowledge transfer within the organisation**: One of the biggest challenges we have that isn't getting quite enough attention is the transfer of tacit knowledge from the outgoing committee to the incoming one.

- **More inclusive activities**: Due to varying levels of experience among students, activities need to be organised in such a way that does not alienate newer, lesser experienced students.

### Proposal ###

In the short term, this project will first attempt to address the issue of matching our students' interests with the right activities. Whereas improvements to industry engagement and knowledge transfer would be long-term objectives that would take place throughout the year.

For the remaining months of the semester, I'll be focusing my efforts on gauging student interest and obtaining their feedback on what they would like to see next year. Their feedback plays a crucial role in the planning of events and activities for the upcoming year.

I have two and a half years before graduation. In this time, I would also like to build a platform where industry partners can engage with our students directly. This would allow both parties to get to know each other on a deeper level and hopefully this translates into better success rates in students' applications for graduate programs.

### Proposal's impact ###

The project would impact both students and employers.

Students benefit by gaining a better understanding of the positions available and what they can expect to get out of a particular program. This will enable students to make informed decisions when applying for jobs after graduation.

It also would sate the industry's demand for capable graduates. By educating students on how to best prepare themselves for employment, the industry would have a larger pool of quality graduates to work with every year.

To quote a talent acquisition manager I met recently:
> Finding the right people for a graduate program is a lot like dating. Both student and employer has to make sure they're a good fit for each other

### Planning for the future ###

**When will you review the impact of your proposal?**

Every six months (at the end of each semester)

**How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?**

Every two to three months (highly situational, would likely have shorter iteration cycles in early stages of the project)

**How will you measure success?**

I'll consider it a success when we have:

- a stable student retention rate in our activities
- students telling us we've played a huge role in landing their first proper job
- graduate recruiters telling us we've made their work a whole lot easier
- industry partners' who are keen to continue collaborating with us

**Other thoughts**

I'm the primary person in charge of industry outreach within the leadership committee, what I'm hoping to achieve in the next couple of years is to search and mentor a successor who will continue working with the existing industry partners who reached out during my tenure. What I've come to notice is that each time a club or society elects a new committee, graduate recruiters will often need to re-establish their relationship with the club because of the resulting unfamiliarity with the new incoming committee.

So the plan is to have a successor shadowing me in meetings and catch-up sessions with industry partners (think of it like pair programming). This gives them a fantastic opportunity to get comfortable talking to people in the industry. Graduate recruiters will also get to familiarise themselves with the up and coming industry liaison they'll be working with in the future.

And we do all this over coffee every time, maybe it's a Melbourne thing :coffee:

**Module selection**

I think modules 2 and 3 would be helpful when undertaking this project. I'm not quite sure what to pick for the third module though. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
