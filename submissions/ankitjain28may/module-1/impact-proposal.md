## Summary of the Community's Needs

As we are the official computer society of our college so we are targeting all the students of our college to help them understand and learn new technologies. The thing that lacks mostly in our college is the open source environment. Most of the students doesn't know about open source and those who knows about open source also wont try to publish their projects and contribute to other projects. Most of the students in our college wont know much about programming so we are targeting primarly to those students who have interest in all of these but due to lack of any factor they are not properly showing their interest.

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: We are targeting to the students of our college and primarly to those having branches like computer science, Information Technology, Electronics and to those who are really passionate towards programming.
- **Communication**: We have facebook group, facebook pages, slack channel and through emails sometimes.
- **Culture**: The culture in our community is very open, friendly and always welcoming new people and ideas.


## Your Proposal

Our main goal is to indulge more and more students in programming, developing and in open source as well so they get familiar with new technologies. We are thinking to organize various workshops like `Workshop on progarmming in C`, `Workshop on web development`, `workshop of Design including UI, UX and Photoshop`, and are for another workshop primarly on `open source` so they will get to know about open source. We are also looking for some technical events and even i am thinking to organize an event `Bug-Smash` in which students find bugs and contribute to our projects on Github. I think this will make them more familiar with the open source and Git workflow. And some Tech-talks on machine learning and thinking for some speaker session.

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Timing**: We usually organize workshops of 2-3 hours after college hours. Such workshops will keep them motivated to their work also. In this year, we are planning to organize more than 5-6 workshops and are looking to organize that 'Bug-Smash' event this semester. But i need time to develop the whole platform else this event will be organized next semester but this event is my primarly aim to indulge more and more students in opensource.

- **Community demographics**: These events are aimed primarly for those students who have joined college this year. But we really want everyone who wants to try their hands at developing software and learning cool stuffs to be welcomed. We usually do that by putting posters in courtyard, Food Courts and in college areas. We make in an announcement in classrooms also to publicize the event so that more no. of students attend the event.

- **Goals**: Our main goal is to increase the no. of students who attends our events and make our workshops and events more user friendly so that they wont get bore. Another goal is to indulge more and more students in open source and make them familiar with Git and Github. Take various workshops to make them clear about the working of Git.

- **Communication**: We use Facebook page for sharing information with students and we have a organization on Github where they can open issues and they can send us mail. In campus students can communicate us at our rooms and in Computer Labs as we are there most of the time after our college hours.


## Your Proposal's Impact


When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - We are targeting the first year students who have joined college this year but we want more people to attend our events and join our community irrespective of branches and year.
- Community needs
  - Our community needs some funding for the events as attracting more people we need to put prizes for the winners to lure them. One more thing, Our community also lacks some contacts as we want to bring people from some great community for organizing Speaker Sessions as these things greatly impact the students. We need space to organize events.
- Resources
  - Space for conducting workshops and events can be arranged by taking permissions from Collge staffs.
  - Funds can also be raised from our alumnis' startups but we need more recognized companies and organization to supports us.
  - New ideas for workshops and events requires lots of brainstorming which we usually do to make the events more user friendly and more interesting.
  - For speaker sessions, we usually reach out to our alumnis for taking sessions and some professors of other colleges.
- Media
  - We use Google Slides to prepare the content of our workshops and make it public after the event which is available to all the students in our college
  - All the source code is always present on Github repos which is also public anyone can learn from there and also contribute to our projects from there.
  - We make video sessions for the workshops to reach out to other students also.
- Content knowledge
  - I am good in taking workshops as i have taken some workshops in our college and i am familiar with the content on which we usually conducts workshops. The workshops that we conducts are always on those topics in which we have a strong hold.
  - Before taking any workshops, we always go through the contents related to topic and have searched for various other topics on google. There are lot of things that we also learn from workshops as students always ask something typical which sometimes make ur to think hard which also help us to learn new things. In case of failure, we tell them after getting to know about it on google, we always believe in learning and clearing the doubts of all the attendes.
- Timeline
  - The workshops will be conducted twice a month in which we dont have any exams.
  - During yearly Technical Fest, we organize various technical events.
  - Looking to organize the Bug Smash event in later half.
  - Conducts speaker session and tech talks.

## Planning for the Future


- We always take the feedback from the attends and ask them to fill the feedback form.
- We organize polls on the topics for the workshops and conducts the one which interests most of the students.
- We always review the events so as to increase the foot fall of students in next event.
- If the students learn and develops something on the topics that we had covered in the workshop, is really a big success for us as they are trying to go deep on those topics which are the main aim for organizing workshops i.e to give them a start.
- After every semester, we change and propose new ideas and plans. After reviewing workshops, we changes if we find people passionate on some hot topics.
