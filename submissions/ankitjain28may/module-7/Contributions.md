When i joined my college, I attend a workshops that was organized by the community of which i am member now. They introduced us about different different fields like Web, Machince Learning, IoT, Open Source, AI and many more. This created a curiosity in me to know more about these fields. I have found my keen interest in Web, Machine Learning and Open Source. From then, I started looking for contributing to some open source projects. It was difficult for me to start but i start by creating my own project from which i learnt a lot about the Git and Github and its workflow which further help me in contributing to other projects.
