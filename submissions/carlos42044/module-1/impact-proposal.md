## Summary of the Community’s Needs
I learned quite a bit more from the community assessment than I thought I would. I realized that my community is actually quite large. That being said only a fraction of the community is actually involved with meetings. One of my goals is to work on getting more students from my community to participate in meetings. I also learned that even though my community has a Slack to communicate in, not many  use it. I need to figure out a better way to get my community to talk with each other. Another important thing that I learned was that there I s no clear procedure on how to deal with disagreements. 
The existing culture I will be working with is mostly comprised of developers. Although the community consists of both CS and IT majors, the CS students have a larger presence. My community needs a stronger IT presence in order to bring in more diversity and just to get students to connect with each other more. I feel like there is a disconnect between IT and CS students. I hope to get students from different majors together and communicating with each other.
## My Proposal
The main thing that I want to accomplish during the Campus Experts program is to be able to provide the best resources that I can to my community. I want to be able to speak with confidence during meetings and present excellent workshops. I want the students in my community to thrive in their future endeavors. Kean is not a very large school, and we are not particularly well known for our computer science department. I want to help change that, I want the students in my community to do great things and succeed. 
I want to become a Campus Expert to help students be the best developers they can be. I want to provide an environment where individuals can meet and collaborate, where students won’t be afraid to ask questions or offer suggestions. I want the community at Kean to be more active with each other. I hope to finish the Campus Experts program by the end of September. Students will be settling in to the new semester and I hope to offer the best help that I can. 
I also want to get students more connected with each other. I see many students just show up to class and go home. Now I know that people have busy lives but I think it’s important to get people connected to each other. I think if I can get more people talking with each other great things can happen. Maybe a student who was hesitant of going to hackathons meets another student who has been to many hackathons. Students can complement each other and learn from each other. 

## My Proposal’s Impact
##### Target Audience 
I am expecting to impact the students of the CS department at Kean University. Mainly the students who have not been very active in the community. 
##### Community Needs
I am addressing the issues of communication within the community as well as offering helpful workshops to learn new skills. 
##### Resources
In order to accomplish my proposal I believe I will mainly need access to the modules offered to students wanting to become Campus Experts. I don’t believe that I will need any other outside resources. My community is fortunate enough to have a venue available for meetings and other resource available to our club. 
##### Media
I will be showing my plan to the community during one of the first ACM meetings in September. I am fortunate to already have a platform setup in order to deliver news to the community. 
##### Content Knowledge
I have not had much experience in most of the technologies that I want to offer workshops in but I plan to learn through online workshops and tutorials. I will be making use of the modules in the Campus Experts training as well as taking advantage of the mlh localhost program.
##### Timeline
I hope to work on these goals for the Fall 2017 semester at Kean. However, I plan to continue the workshops well into the Spring 2018 semester. I also hope to work with future community leaders at Kean to keep up the progress after I graduate this year.

## Planning for the future
I think it is a good idea for me to review the impact of the proposal at the end of every month, even if for just a little. I think one month is a good checkpoint to see the progress that’s been made. I will measure success by asking people in my community if they’ve seen any noticeable change. Again, I plan to iterate monthly on my community plans.
