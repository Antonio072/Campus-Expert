# Assessing My Community's Needs

## Definition
#### Current community: 
I would define my community as **Kean University Students in Computer Science**.
My main community would be students around my university, Kean University, Union, NJ. Our Computer Science department is smaller than most schools but we are growing!
#### Ideal version:
My ideal community would not only consist of the students in the CS department at Kean, but also students interested in CS. I would also like our local community college to join the community.
#### How to improve: 
I would like to open up Kean's computer science meetings to not only Kean student's, but students from nearby highschools or community colleges. This would be a great way to get even more people interested in tech and get people together.

## Size
#### How many people in your community:
There are roughly 500 students in the CS department at Kean.
#### How many would you like to be in your community:
I would love to see Kean's CS department grow! I would also like high school students interested in CS to join my community. That being said if the community could grow by 40 or 50 people by the end of the year, that would be great!
#### Historically has the group been the same size?
The community has been slowly growing along with Kean's CS department. As more students joing the CS department the community grows. 

## Resources 
#### What is currently available in your community to learn about tech?
We have monthly ACM meetings where all students are free to attend and learn more about events the CS department is hosting. The ACM club has also traditionally held informative workshops. Students also have access to 2 netlabs furnished with computers and whiteboards.
Kean has also held 4 hackathons in the past.
