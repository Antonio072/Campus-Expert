# Assessing My Community's Needs

## Definition
#### Current community: 
I would define my community as **Kean University Students in Computer Science**.
My main community would be students around my university, Kean University, Union, NJ. Our Computer Science department is smaller than most schools but we are growing!
#### Ideal version:
My ideal community would not only consist of the students in the CS department at Kean, but also students interested in CS. I would also like our local community college to join the community.
#### Ideas on how to improve: 
I would like to open up Kean's computer science meetings to not only Kean student's, but students from nearby highschools or community colleges. This would be a great way to get even more people interested in tech and get people together.

## Size
#### Current community: 
How many people in your community?
There are roughly 500 students in the CS department at Kean.

How many would you like to be in your community?
I would love to see Kean's CS department grow! I would also like high school students interested in CS to join my community. That being said if the community could grow by 40 or 50 people by the end of the year, that would be great!

Historically has the group been the same size?
The community has been slowly growing along with Kean's CS department. As more students joing the CS department the community grows. 
#### Ideal version:
Larger community of not only CS students, as well as students from nearby community college and highschool students interested in tech.
#### Ideas on how to improve: 
Plan to communicate with local community colleges and highschools to invite students to Kean's ACM meetings.

## Resources 
#### What is currently available in your community to learn about tech?
We have monthly ACM meetings where all students are free to attend and learn more about events the CS department is hosting. The ACM club has also traditionally held informative workshops. Students also have access to 2 netlabs furnished with computers and whiteboards. CS department office hours are typically from 9am - 4pm.

Kean has also held 4 hackathons in the past. We hope to host up to 200-250 students for the upcoming 2018 hackathon.
#### Ideal Version: 
Ideally I would like to be able to offer more workshops to students to improve and learn new technologies.

## Accessibility
* Currently resources are only accessible to Kean University students.
* Meetings are held during college hour, 3:30pm to 4:30pm.
* Childcare is not available.

## Interests
Currently the community is made up of the CS department at Kean. That includes CS majors, IT majors, and CIS majors. I would like the community to include people who are interested in tech, not just CS students.

There are students in the community who get together and play video games or share hobby's such as photography.
