# Assessing My Community's Needs

## Definition
#### Current community: 
I would define my community as **Kean University Students in Computer Science**.
My main community would be students around my university, Kean University, Union, NJ. Our Computer Science department is smaller than most schools but we are growing!
#### Ideal version:
My ideal community would not only consist of the students in the CS department at Kean, but also students interested in CS. I would also like our local community college to join the community.
#### Ideas on how to improve: 
I would like to open up Kean's computer science meetings to not only Kean student's, but students from nearby high schools or community colleges. This would be a great way to get even more people interested in tech and get people together.

## Size
#### Current community: 
How many people in your community?

There are roughly 500 students in the CS department at Kean.

How many would you like to be in your community?

I would love to see Kean's CS department grow! I would also like high school students interested in CS to join my community. That being said if the community could grow by 40 or 50 people by the end of the year, that would be great!

Historically has the group been the same size?

The community has been slowly growing along with Kean's CS department. As more students join the CS department the community grows. 
#### Ideal version:
Larger community of not only CS students, as well as students from nearby community college and high school students interested in tech.
#### Ideas on how to improve: 
Plan to communicate with local community colleges and high schools to invite students to Kean's ACM meetings.

## Resources 
#### Current community:
What is currently available in your community to learn about tech?

We have monthly ACM meetings where all students are free to attend and learn more about events the CS department is hosting. The ACM club has also traditionally held informative workshops. Students also have access to 2 netlabs furnished with computers and whiteboards. CS department office hours are typically from 9am - 4pm.

Kean has also held 4 hackathons in the past. We hope to host up to 200-250 students for the upcoming 2018 hackathon.
#### Ideal Version: 
Ideally I would like to be able to offer more workshops to students to improve and learn new technologies.
#### Ideas on how to improve:
I really hope to gain the necessary skills to better serve my community by becoming a Campus Expert! I also plan to take advantage of the mlh localhost program to give better and more informative tech workshops.

## Accessibility
* Currently resources are only accessible to Kean University students.
* Meetings are held during college hour, 3:30pm to 4:30pm.
* Childcare is not available.
#### Ideal Version: 
Maybe try to somehow make meetings more available to those who cannot attend at college hour? Only problem is college hour is the one time that most students are available to meet.
#### Ideas on how to improve:
Maybe ACM can live stream meetings so people can tune in from wherever they are.

## Interests
#### Current community:
Currently the community is made up of the CS department at Kean. That includes CS majors, IT majors, and CIS majors. I would like the community to include people who are interested in tech, not just CS students. 

There are students in the community who get together and play video games or share hobby's such as photography.
#### Ideal Version:
I'd like the community to be more inclusive of students of all majors who are interested in tech.
#### How to improve:
Advertise ACM meetings throughout Kean's campus, not just in the CS building.

## Goals
I think people in the community mostly get involved hoping to ramp-up to get a job. The ACM chapter at Kean helps students with resumes, internship applications, and interview prep. I would say that mostly the CS majors are passionate about developing. I've heard from many IT majors that they really don't like to develop.
I would say one of my main goals for the community would be to offer better workshops to learn new skills and get people more interested in developing.

## Location 
My community gathers at Kean's North Avenue Academic building. We typically meet around 3 times a month for ACM meetings. There is parking but only available to students, there are guest passes available. The location is very accessible, Kean is largely a commuter college so our members are already traveling to the school. Fortunately, we do not have to pay for the space where we meet. The space is set up lecture style, PowerPoint ready. We have quite a few options where we can accommodate anywhere from 30 t0 120 students. There is comfortable seating. We offer pizza and refreshments during meetings.

#### Ideal Version: 
I don't think our space can improve anymore than it already has. Our department used to be in an older building with limited space. We are now in a new building.

## Communication
We have a dedicated slack channel where every member of the ACM can join. We also have a twitter account where students can go look at pictures of events we've held.
#### Ideal Version: 
Ideally I would like to see more participation from students in the slack. Our slack is not very active. 
#### How to improve: 
I'd like to show off some of the features slack offers in an attempt to entice people to use it more. I also think I have to find more interesting material to post on the slack. 

## Culture
The ACM is very welcoming to new members. We try and be extremely helpful and open to anybody who wants to join us. We always try and be very welcoming. If there is a disagreement we like to take a moment to calm down and talk it out. We find its often better to walk away from a situation and cool down, then come back with a level head to resolve the situation. I do not think there are any procedures documented or in place. I would personally ask the participants to take a moment and think about the situation from the other party's point of view. 
#### Ideal Version: 
I would like to open up a suggestion box to see what the ACM can improve on. I think it's also a good idea to document how to handle disagreements.
#### How to improve: 
It will be a good idea to talk to the members of the community and agree on a policy or procedure to deal with disagreements.
