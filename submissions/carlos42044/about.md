# About Me
Hi everyone! My name is Carlos, I'm a computer science major at Kean University in Union, NJ. I love to program and collaborate on new projects with new people.
Fun fact I used to be an early childhood special education major. Although I changed my major to cs, I am still passionate about education! I try and provide as much help as I can to my peers and I know that becoming a campus expert will really help with that!
## Community
I am president of the ACM student chapter at Kean University and lead organizer of HackKean 2018, I'm also a computer science tutor for Kean's peer-to-peer tutoring service whenever I have free time.

## Hobbies/Interests
In my free time I like to try new hobbies! I've done freshwater fishkeeping, planted tanks, shrimp-keeping, knitting, longboarding, painting, and a bunch of other things.
