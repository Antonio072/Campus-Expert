Hello!

My name is William Dai, and I am a second year undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering Computer Science and Business Administration (intended double major) at the University of California, Berkeley.
In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels, perusing scientific literature, and (surprise!) coding/learning how to code.

I am particularly fascinated by the fields of cyber security, neuroscience, and blockchain (distributed ledger technology) use cases.

Last but not least: FAVORITE EMOJI: :partyparrot: :D
