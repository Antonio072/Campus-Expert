How would you define your community? 

As an engineering student at UC Berkeley, I've noticed that while the university as a whole is fairly well gender-balanced, it is not nearly so in my computer science/electrical engineering classes. I'm not sure what the exact numbers are, but it may be between 30% female, 70% male and 45/55.

Tech is definitely a huge draw for students here at Cal; I feel like the career fairs that get the most attention are Tech, then Business. There are countless student organizations that specialize in various aspects of tech, and some that promote tech evangelism/outreach among local Bay Area high schools.

The penetration testing/security hacking community here feels more gender balanced,
