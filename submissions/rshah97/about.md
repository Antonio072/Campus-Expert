# About Ryan

Hi everyone, my name is Ryan Shah. I am currently a student attending Rutgers University - New Brunswick. I study
computer science and economics. 

## Clubs

The two clubs that I am currently involved in right now are HackRU and The Rutgers Economic Society (or RECONS for short). In HackRU, 
I am the current Food Director and in RECONS I was webmaster. I decided to step down from the EBOARD in RECONS to be able to 
spend more time with the CS Community and HackRU.

## Interests

Some of my current interests consist of running, working out, and reading. I like reading books of all types, whether they be
nonfiction, fantasy, sci-fi, or just generic dramas. I also spend a large amount of time reading the news to try and stay informed about
what is happening in the world. 

## Favorite Emoji

My favorite emoji is definitely ðŸ˜¬.
