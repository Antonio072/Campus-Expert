## About Me 

Hi everyone!

My name is Shubha and I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Science and Economics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I help organize Hack CU and I am also actively involved in my school's Women in Computing chapter. 


## Interests 

I enjoy learning and trying new things. Lately, I've been learning about data science, ML, and building AR apps. During my free time I also enjoy taking pictures, trying to cook one of [these](https://www.facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty/), and exploring new coffee shops.
