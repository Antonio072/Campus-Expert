## Analyzing a community I do not manage 

One of the incidents I have seen on on-line communities are the ones where people 
have an idea about something, they are 100% sure about it and they don't care if that 
idea or that thought is rude, hostile or can hurt someone.
I was surfing on a community and I saw some male chauvinist comment, it didn't look 
like a troll, he was just communicating his ideas, a lot of people started replying 
the message with more aggressive comments. The moderators talk to him privatively
so that he can understand the it was not the place nor the way to talk about these 
kind of things, he seemed to understand and he apologized in the same comment.
I think the outcome was positive because he seemed to understand, even if his 
ideas haven't changed, he understood that a tech community is not the right 
place to talk about it.
I think they way the moderators managed the problem was very good, but still not 
the best, I think it would have been a good idea if they can post an a message 
to the guy in the comments, so it is clear to everybody what really happened, and 
that everybody knows that there is a control and a management on the group.

### Nature of the incident 

Last year I was the director of the MxHacks, a very famous hackathon in Mexico, 
we were sponsored by a huge and famous company. I can say they were the must 
difficult and mean sponsors I have ever had, during the planning months it was 
very difficult to work with them, at the end we did the hackathon and it was a 
very good event, one day after the event, they took the art and the design of 
the hackathon and they put their logo on top of the hackathons' logo. 
The designers of the team wrote a message on Facebook and spreading it all around 
saying that this company stole our art and that they were taking advantage on us, 
I can't say that was false, but it was not the way to solve the problem, on my 
side I tried to talk with them politely so that they can take out their logo 
from the top of our logo.
They took the logo out of our art and they apologized after all the movement 
that was on social media. At the end the outcome was what we expected, that they 
apologize and take their logo out from our art, but I didn't like the way it was
handled, I think my job was to take the movement on social media down and solve 
the problem on a professional way.
