# GiTec

## Definition 
I started learning git at the beginning of my degree because I was involved with many
developer communities, it was very hard because I barely knew how to use the command line,
a few semesters later, we had a professor that asked us to deliver the homeworks
trough GitHub and everybody was struggling because nobody knew how to use it, so I did
a quick tutorial, to share with my friends with the basics, add, commit, pull and push.
After that I spoke to the degree director because I thought that learning how to use
git is essential in any developers career. Now we have a space in a class
where every new student that joins the degree has to take where we teach them the basics, the ones that
are interested on learning more stuff there is a weekly workshop where we teach them
different things (most of the time web development) using GitHub, working in teams
so that they can merge, do pull requests and learn more advanced git.
We also do many other events, no so frequent as the workshops, but we do meetups
and hackathons.


## Resources
Now a days, since we have the support of the university we can get a classroom
where we can give our workshops, they also help us broadcasting the the info about the courses so
that everybody can join regardless of their major.


## Size
We are more or less 30 people each semester, we also work with an other student
organization in which they try to make tech events for everybody once a month  more
or less and many times they ask us to help with it.

## Accessibility 
The workshops are mostly to students of Tec, but all the meetups, hackathons and
and summits that we organize are open for everybody from all around the world.

## Interests
Most of the people that sign up to this kind of events are students with majors 
in computer science or computer engineering 


## Goals
The idea of this community is that students can learn all that they need to learn before
start working so that they don't have the problem that when they arrive to a new job
after graduating they know what they have to do and from where they can start.


## Communication
Currently we talk through WhatsApp and mail.

## Location 
We are located on our university, Tec de Monterry CSF.

## Culture
In most of the workshops there are exercises, every time someone finishes the 
exercise before others, they start helping each other. When someone joins 
the community they can instantly feel the support and the nice vibes.
