# Community Impact Tec

## Summary of the Community's Needs
After talking to some people involved on the community and to some members of the 
Computer Engineering school we realize that the most important thing that we need 
is to turn this workshops into a more formed community where we can interact more
and people feel they are part of this thing so after the semester is over, they can 
continue teaching what they learned.
 **Community demographics**: We are around 30 people each semester, most of the people 
 is studding Computer Science or Computer Engineering from first semesters and 
 we have a few entrepreneurs from also the first half of the degree.
 **Communication**: I think what would be better is to have a WhatsApp group 
 because we are very few people, but when the group starts growing, I think we
 will have to move to slack.
 **Culture**: I think the Culture we have now is great, but I believe that we can 
 make it better if people are part of it until they finish the degree or at least 
 longer than a semester. 
 

## Proposal
There are 3 things that will change on the community, 
  1. People will stay for longer so that they can teach now people and learn new stuff
  2. Encourage all the Computer majors to get better on their git skills so that 
     when they arrive to a job they can be able to work in teams
  3. Encourage the business and entrepreneurship majors to learn how to code
  
 **Timing**: First week: talk to the group from last semester to join the group again and invite people to participate
             Second week: make the full schedule of the course and invite people to participate
             Third week: Start with two courses, level 0 and level 1 for veterans 
             fourth and fifth weeks: do the workshops 
             sixth week: make a big workshop for more people, maybe like 60 to 80 open to everybody  
 **Community demographics**: The community has been growing in the past year, every semester we have more and
 more compromised students, the problem is that they don't come back because we have
 the same material as last time.
 What I think the next step is to have a kind of "levels"
 so that the new ones can learn all the basic stuff and the "veterans" can learn
 new and more exciting things. The best thing about this is that
 a student that took the workshop one semester before could give the same classes
 to the new students ( of course making sure that he/she is ready to give it).
 **Goals**:The idea of this community is that students can learn all that they need to learn before
 start working so that they don't have the problem that when they arrive to a new job
 after graduating they know what they have to do and from where they can start.
 **Communication**: We will open a WhatsApp group where we can talk and on the way 
 the community gets bigger, we can move to slack. Also a Facebook group or page 
 to invite people to our big and open events.
 
## Proposal's Impact
With this plan we expect to have a very good impact in computer majors and in people 
from business school who have an idea and wants to develop it.
We think that this is going to have a great impact in both, Computer major and 
business school because they will be able to learn real stuff that they will use 
afterwards.
 Target audience
   - Computer Engineers
   - Electrical Engineers
   - Business school students
 Community needs
   - Develop real life applications 
   - Give more workshops 
   - Official Communication channel 
   - Official GitHub organization
 Resources
   - We could invite people from other communities to give talks or god professors 
     we have access to.
 Media
   - We can do tutorials for each workshop we give 
   - We can do streaming.

 
 ## Planning for the Future
 
 In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:
 
 When will you review the impact of your proposal?
   - At the end of the first iteration
 How will you measure success?
   - Talking to veterans that already used their skills for something
 How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
   - Each 4 months
