Hello, I am Margot Duek. I am from Mexico City, I am 23 years old, I study Computer Engineering and I am currently working at Nearshore Delivery Solutions as a developer and community master. Since I started my degree I felt in love with the community life, I started working at a hacker school which has a great community, after that, I started organizing hackathons, 
which I think is the most fun thing ever. I also started two Google Developer Groups, one for Polymer (a web components library made
by Google) and another one to encourage woman into tech. 

Hobbies:
There are 3 things that I enjoy most in life, first I love eating, trying new food and enjoying the old food that I already know.
Second, I love doing sports, more specific high adrenaline sports like snowboarding and climbing. I also enjoy a lot doing triathlons and other competitions alike.
And the third thing is going out with friends and/or family.
