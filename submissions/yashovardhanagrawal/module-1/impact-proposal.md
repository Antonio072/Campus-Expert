## Summary of the Community's Needs

The LNM Institute of Information Technology, as the name suggests is an institute dedicated to the sector of IT, though it provides exposure for other fields except CSE. Being located in one of the more developed cities in India, having a coding culture almost best in India, LNMIIT provides the best possible atmosphere for young budding CS enthusiasts to grow. Our student communities (CSI LNMIIT Chapter & Cybros Computer Club) help in the betterment of this coding culture and keeping up the enthusiasm amongst the students. We have a dedicated team of students working really hard for the betterment of the community, though the participation from the female side if quite good, our aim is to increase their participation in more technical fields than managerial. Community also needs a better way of organizing things in which GitHub is proving itself very useful currently. Encouraging people for using git is one of the more important tasks we are focussed on. Every year more and more people are joining our community making it one the largest student CSI communities in India hence proper regulations are need to be maintained.


## Your Proposal

As a community our main aim is to increase participation along with the better management and distribution of works. For this I had proposed for a dedicated GitHub organization for the better distribution of works. For teaching purposes we are using GitHub Classroom as a better way to manage things. We have different teams assigned for different purposes. Proper contribution guidelines are mentioned and deadlines are mentioned for people to complete their work in the given time. For better communication I proposed using a Gitter Channel along side the current Google Group Mailing List.
For increasing participation we request our current community members to tell the other students about the perks of joining the organization. Offering projects to interested people providing them mentors to help them achieve their targets not only increases people's interest but also helps them in the long run. We request our faculty mentors to address the students from time to time we help them keep up the enthusiasm and dedication towards the field of computer science.
