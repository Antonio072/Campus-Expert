## Definition

  I am a student of the LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur India. A college widely known for its coding culture, especially in the Open Source Community. In GSoC selections, our college's open source community managed the top 10 most selection worldwide. Our college's computer clubs are quite wide and are divided into many divisions. There are 2 major Computer Science Clubs, namely `Computer Society of India (CSI), LNMIIT Students' Chapter` and `Cybros - the Computer Club`. Cybros basically deals with taking classes for specific topics for the college students and CSI for managing events. Cybros is further divided into divisions according to the Languages and Tech Stack people are interested while CSI has its Technical Team and Managerial Team. I being on of the heads of Front End Division in Cybros and Technical Team Core Member of CSI, am a part of the major decisions taken by the student community.

  - Our whole college labs use Linux as their only Operating System.
  - Almost 20% of our community members are female, and many of them have cracked Google Summer of Code.
  - Our college community holds Winter & Summer Projects for students to participate in. Also, there are many projects given to students as a part of classes taken for a specific language.

## Size
  The CSI has 280 members approx. and Cybros about 50. The managerial community of CSI consists of 40 members approx. Our alumni are also quite active and help us with various queries of the club. Every year we have a recruitment drive where we are more than happy to welcome new motivated and passionate student willing to contribute their best to the club. About the current strength, I think its quite an ideal strength for our college activities.

## Resources
  As mentioned earlier Cybros deals with taking classes for the college students and CSI deals with other CS related events happening in the college like Hackathons, Workshops, Meetups etc. Most of the discussions happen over our mailing lists and chat groups but at least a weekly meeting is called every Saturday/ Sunday to keep up the enthusiasm going amongst the student community.
  - Cybros aims to conduct at least 3 classes a week for every tech stack.
  - Monthly an intra college hackathon is conducted for the students to test their skills and get an experience of pitching their products in front of judges.
  - Summer and Winter Internship projects are organized for interested students who are willing to dedicate their holidays doing some productive open source work.

## Accessibility

  Our student community is quite well managed with people having different positions and quite nicely divided work. Being the students of the same college the environment is quite informal and friendly. Github serves as the best medium to organize our work and set deadlines for everyone according to the workflow.

## Interests

  * Our community is exclusive of LNMIIT students, having interest in the field of Computer Science. Their stream of study does not matter to us as CS as a field is quite diverse and also interdisciplinary actions are much promoted in our college culture.

  * Being a large student community we never burden people with club related work. People volunteer for their choice of works. Like almost every college, our college also has student communities related to their fields of interests like music, dance, drama, astronomy etc. people are free to join any of them and take leaves if they have something pre-planed there.

## Goals

  * Student community grows if the students grow. The main aim we have is to help our club members excel in whatever field they choose.
  * Our CSI Chapter has already been awarded the best chapter award in the whole country thrice. We hope to uphold this legacy and set an example with our works.
  * Few of the major events planned this year will be an MLH Sponsored Hackathon, which we want to host first in whole India. We hope to get assistance from your side for that.
  * Main goal why these clubs were founded in our college is to spread awareness about CS and attract people towards it helping them achieve what they want in life.
