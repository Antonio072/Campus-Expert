# Open source contributions.
Our whole community works on the belief that open source is the future of CS. Contributing on open source not only increases your skills and learn new technologies, it also helps you to showcase your works and helps you build great contacts with some great developers around the globe.

Few of my open source contributions:
- I run an open source organization:
  https://github.com/Addy-Smart-Addresses
- Recently I fixed some minor issues in the README.md file in FOSSASIA Loklak repository
  https://github.com/fossasia/loklak_search/pull/566
- I have made a few websites which I open sourced
  https://github.com/yashovardhanagrawal/Chinmaya-Site
  https://github.com/yashovardhanagrawal/Bikaner-MUN
  https://github.com/yashovardhanagrawal/AstroClub
  https://github.com/yashovardhanagrawal/SAEIndia-LNMIIT
  https://github.com/yashovardhanagrawal/LYP

These were some of the highlights of my open source works. Other than these, our organizations are totally open source with the study materials and student projects showcased on our organizations' respective pages.
