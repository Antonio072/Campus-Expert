  5. Question Answer Session: 15-30 mins

# Demonstrations and examples
  * The workshop will start with making people know the difference between Git and GitHub as many people think they are the same thing, giving examples of other alternatives to GitHub that work on a similar principle.
  * Making people understand the necessity of using version control systems, how they increase the productivity and organizes works, showing them examples of the biggest open source communities.

# Discussions and pairing opportunities
  * Before the workshop a short survey will be taken to ensure the knowledge level of the people attending it, content will be decided accordingly.
  * Some community members who are experienced with Git will be there to help the participants individually.
  * Participants are free to discuss among themselves, making it possible for them to learn and code together and keep up with the pace of the workshop.

# Recovery points
  * There would be a Gitter channel dedicated towards the workshop where people can ask their questions and get answers not only from the workshop mentors but their colleagues too.
  * Presentation/ slides will be provided to everyone through the Gitter channel itself.
  * Some community members who are experienced with Git will be there to help the participants individually.
  * The workshop will be divided into different parts and sessions hence if a person is left behind in the earlier session, he/she can ask for help before the beginning of the next session.
  * Every session will also be followed by a question answer session wherein people can discuss their queries.

# Learner participation
  * The workflow of the workshop will be from the beginner level to advanced making it easier for people to correlate with whatever they know and progress accordingly.
  * Cracking a few jokes here and there during the workshop is definitely quite an effective way to keep learners' interest.
  * Giving real life examples help people to understand better and hence keeping their interest upright.
  * During the different sessions of the workshop, we can plan some fun competitions for the participants based on what they have learned till now.
  * Swags are the mostly the best way to attract people, laptop stickers and t-shirts will be given to the attendees. Some special gifts will be given to the people who are quite actively participating during the workshop.

# Adapting to your participants
  * Before the workshop a short survey will be taken to ensure the knowledge level of the people attending it, content will be decided accordingly.
  * During the workshop, all the material will be available to the participants in their local systems, helping them keep up with the flow of the workshop. Similarly for people who know more than others can have a view at the content and explore more for the time being when something they know is being taught.
  * Some community members who are experienced with Git will be there to help the participants individually.
  * After the workshop a survey will be conducted to get to know the experiences of the participants attending the workshop, what better we could do and their comments. Future workshops will have those reforms within them.
# What happens after?
  * All the material of the workshop will be with the participant to take a review of what was taught in the workshop.
  * A GitHub Cheat Sheet will be provided to the participants for quick review of the basic commands they would be using.
  * The Gitter channel will be active for the students to ask our their problems and suggestions.
  * A short makeup session may be organised on the basis of the needs of the participants.
  * After the workshop a survey will be conducted to get to know the experiences of the participants attending the workshop, what better we could do and their comments. Future workshops will have those reforms within them.
