## About Me
Howdy, my name is Aaron (not like the username didn't give it away). I'm in the Science and Engineering Foundation Programme at the University of Nottingham (in the UK), on track to start my BSc in Computer Science next year (2018). I've been programming for nearly half my life now, and have invoved it in some form in just about every aspect of my life (even if it's totally uneccesarry). I've been a GitHub member for nearly five years now, but didn't really begin to embrace it's true potential until last November when I attended my first Hackatho. At present, I've attended three, but I expect that number to go up quite a bit.

## Interests
Other than programming, my major interests are flight simulation (all aspects of it), if you've heard of th VATSIM Network, I'm heavily involved in it these days. I also love travelling, exploring, and just discovering new things. I love to learn, especially random tidbits that no one cares about, but that's just who I am. I'm also an avid photographer, it's been a big part of my life since I finally got a DSLR of my own when I was 16, Nikon is the best.
