## Hi Friends!

My name is MJ Ramos. Yes like Michael Jackson.

I am a double degree student at Florida International University studying Marketing and Finance (idk what i'm doing here either lol)

I am also getting certificates in Social Media + E-Marketing Analytics as well as Logistics + Import/Export.

I got brought onto the tech community here in Miami through a friend of mine when I told him I wanted to indulge in my interest of tech.

My favorite emoji is definitely ðŸ™ƒ , because i can't seem to take myself seriously.
