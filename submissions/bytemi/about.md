Hello! My name is Megan O'Connor. I am a current undergraduate student at North Carolina State University studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. At my school, I am a member of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) and serve on the board of Women in Computer Science (WiCS). Super excited to apply to become a Github campus expert and meet everyone here!! :D
