## Women in Computer Science (WiCS) - RTP

### Definition
- Who we are:
  - Undergraduate and Graduate Computer Science students at NC State
  - Other students/individuals with an interest in programming and computer science
  - Faculty in the NC State Computer Science Department
  - A primarily female-student led board

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community? : we currently have ~350 members in our Facebook group
- As a goal, it would be great to get at least 80% of the female student body in CS to get involved in our community 
- Interest in our group has grown significantly due to the increasing percentage of female students at our college declaring Computer Science as a major

### Resources
- We have a website where people can find resources on our meetings, GHC conference scholarship, and outside scholarships and opportunities
- We host regular general body meetings, coding nights, a mini career-fair, industry panel, and a yearly hackathon - DiamondHacks

### Accessibility
- The majority of our events are held on-campus, so it may be hard for students and professionals living off-campus to attend.
- In general, most of our meetings are coordinated to be held at times that are in the evening, and after peak class hours; It might be hard for those interning or working in the evening to attend. 
- Our organization does not provide child-care services.

- Ideal: 
  - Child-care services and services for new mothers is something that our university is in need of, and something many people have requested. Having such services local to our centennial engineering campus would be a great help to the female faculty and staff who serve on that campus, as well as students and professionals wanting to attend our events. 
  
### Interests
- Majority:
  - Most of our attendees are undergraduate/graduate students in CS as well as those doing the Computer Programming minor
  - However, we also get attendees in ECE, IT, Business, and students from other majors who just have an interest in tech
- We are open to any topic, provided that it isn't controversial or makes any of our members uncomfortable

### Goals
- People join our coding nights events for a less-competitive and more relaxed event that develops programming interview-question skills
- Other events appeal to those looking for a job/internship, and spending time with other women passionate about technology
- Ideal:
  - have a few events to focus on programming as it relates to hardware, as we have primarily focused on software topics and there is a growing interest from some of our members on how to make wearables and other devices. 

### Location
- We host meetings at various buildings on our main and centennial campus, depending on which rooms are available for booking. 
- We will host our annual DiamondHacks hackathon overnight at our school's student building
- In general, our group meets primarily in-person
- There is parking, which is free after 5pm Monday to Friday, and generally when we host our events
- Our campuses are connected by a free-to-public busline that runs between the two, with some stops shared with the local city busline. 
- The locations are in general more-accessible to those on-campus
- The location of the majority of our meetings do not cost anything to book
- Most of the rooms we book are flexible for a variety of meetings (have a projector, large space with desks, open areas)
- In general, the rooms can fit between 30-100+ people
- Most rooms can suit a variety of people, however meetings in our general classrooms may be uncomfortable for larger people or those with longer legs due to the size of the mounted desk-chairs. 
- There are water fountains local to all of our meetings, and we usually provide food/snacks for general meetings and our coding nights

### Communication
- We have a campus mailing-list for our members, as well as a regularly-updated Facebook group for our organization, board, and DiamondHacks event; we also have a Twitter for DiamondHacks and WiCS. 

- Ideal: 
  - We could benefit on having a GitHub organization for either WiCS or DiamondHacks

### Culture
- Our group is super open to anyone with an interest in CS and programming. We try our best to encourage incoming freshmen, male students, and those outside the CS major that they can participate as a long as they have an interest!
- We deal with disagreeements in a civil fashion. It is hard sometimes, as we get many comments from male students on it is unfair that there cannot be a "Men in Computer Science" organization (basically the department....), but we must explain to them the situation everytime, as well as informing them that in no way is WiCS closed to male students joining. In fact, we actively encourage it!
- We have doctrines set in place for our club, and all documentation on board meetings/meetings with faculty are well-organized in a google drive. 

- Ideal: 
  - Getting more supportive male members to join our organization and get involved with our events
