## Summary of the Community's Needs

- **Community demographics**: From our Facebook group of current and alumni members, we are over 300 members strong, although we typically get around 50 people showing up regularly for general meetings and events. Our annual hackathon, DiamondHacks, usually hosts around 200 participants. 
- **Communication**: We have a fairly robust communication system: we actively utilize social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as maintaining a weekly email blurb to our members and keeping an up to date website on WiCS and DiamondHacks as well as any upcoming events. 
- **Culture**: The culture of WiCS is very open. We make sure to reach out not only to female undergraduates in computer science, but also graduate students, students outside of CSC but with an interest in Tech, and male students. 


## Your Proposal
We would like to propose a series of beginners workshops, to be held twice a month, to teach tracks of certain technologies not focused on in class (such as a web-development program utilizing the free resources of FreeCodeCamp or a mobile development program using the free resources offered by Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree).

- **Timing**: 90 minute workshops held twice a month with 2-3 topic tracks. 
- **Community demographics**: To get more WiCS members actively participating in the club. Some members might not come to every social event, so this would be a productive way for them to participate and learn something they are interested in that will also benefit their resume. 
- **Goals**: Increase WiCS participation and participation of male students, graduate students, and other non-CSC students with an interest in Tech. 
- **Communication**: A possible Slack group with channels divided for multiple topic tracks so participants can stay in touch with each other on progress and ask each other questions. An email blurb added to the WiCS email and/or CSC department email notifying CSC students to the workshops.

## Your Proposal's Impact
- Target audience
  - Students interested in topics not focused on in class (to be ranked by popularity through a quiz to our members) such as: Unity development, mobile applications, and web development. 
- Community needs
  - To provide a community workshop environment for students to learn skills of interest not taught in class. 
- Resources
  - Possible support and lightning talks from local companies.
  - WiCS already has a strong connection with many companies. Support will likely be as easy as an email/phone call away. 
- Media
  - Advertise through our social media accounts; reach out to the university library/CSC dept to help advertise the workshops and provide classroom to host events.
  - Prepare a proposal to the WiCS advisers/library. 
- Content knowledge
  - I have enough knowledge in terms of app development to lead basic workshops, and can pick up material quickly. A lot of our workshop material would be accessed from free resources where attendants can also practice on their own time. 
  - FreeCodeCamp, Udacity, and other free mediums. Other WiCS board leaders have varying experience in game development, algorithms, web development, etc. 
- Timeline
  - Finish a certain section of FreeCodeCamp/etc by the end of the semester; possibly set up multiple tracks depending on if new people would like to join the series after the first semester.
  - Workshops will be roughly 90 minutes long. 
  - First 20 minutes of workshop: overview of lesson topics / short talk by sponsor company. Remaining 60-70 minutes: individual/group work on lesson exercises with access to github ambassadors for questions. 

## Planning for the Future

- Will review impact at end of first semester. 
- Success will be measured by the number of participants at the end of the semester, and by how far in the curriculum on average participants have proceded in the curriculum. 
- Impact will be iterated once a semester, with a progress check mid-semester.
