# Community assessment

## Current community and size

I define my community as the students interested in improving their programming skills, mainly web development skills, in the University of Helsinki. In particular, the female population interested in developing their skills. At the moment, there are around 10 of us, and we plan to expand. We love attending various hackathons around the city, and have been to about 5 so far in a year. 

## Resources and Interests

We are all students at the Department of Computer Science, and so we make use of all the resources provided to us by the university including laptops and online tools. We try to meetup once a week, but often end up meeting only when a hackathon is being organized around us. A few of us also work part-time, so that makes it a little difficult to meet regularly.

Some of us are more inclined towards machine learning and backend web development, while some front-end. Therefore we usually end up complimenting each other. In general though, we are open to a diverse set of applications of CS. We have also finished two projects with Raspberry pis and Arduinos.

## Goals

People are probably drawn to it because it is fun to code in a group and people are more interested in improving their coding skills, so they also get peer reviewed in the process. 

## Location and Communication

We meet up at the university premises, or at hackathon venues usually. We use an IRC channel or emails to communicate with each other.

## Culture

The community is very open to learning new things, and we have very funfilled gatherings teaching new things to each other and looking for projects to take up.
