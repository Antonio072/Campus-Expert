# Impact Proposal

## Summary of communities needs

### Community Demographics and Communication

The community consists of women who study at the University of Helsinki and have opted to study Computer Science as their major or minor studies.

At the moment, we use IRC and email to communicate, but we are open to other forms of communications as well.

## Culture

We do not have a code of conduct yet, and we are working on it. We plan to have a strong code of conduct such that in the event differences and disagreements arise, we should have a good resolution mechanism.
We do not meet up very frequently owing to schedule issues, and I have a plan in mind to help us meet more often and help the community grow.

# Your Proposal

I want to allocate a specific area for our meetups, so that anyone who wants to code can use that area and also get to meet other people who are passionate about the same things that they are. I would also like to organize trips to different companies to create more incentive for people to join us.

## Timing
The best timing would be when the next semester starts, but before the exam periods begin in December. The orientation week would be a good time to get people up to speed on what we have been doing so far and our values.

## Goals
My goal is to get people interested to join our group and bring in some diversity so that it benefits all of us.

## Communication

As indicated earlier, we will continue to use IRC and emails unless someone points out a better communication channel.


# Proposal's Imapct

## Target Audience
I plan to impact people (mostly women students of the University of Helsinki) who aim to take their coding skills to an advanced level.

## Community needs 
### What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
I am addressing the lack of a tech community for women at the university of Helsinki aimed at helping those of intermediate skill level to develop and move on to the advanced-level communities.

## Resources
### What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
We already have all the resouerces I would need. 

## Media
### How are you preparing to deliver your community impact proposal?
I will start with advertising during the orientation week with the help of student ambassadors of the university.

### What are you going to prepare to deliver the content?
I will write a blog post on the university website, to increase the visibility and also put up ads on the notice boards at the university. 

## Content knowledge
### How knowledgable are you on the topic your community impact proposal focuses on?
As indicated earlier, we have been hosting a few meetups and attending hackathons over the past year. Therefore, I believe I have a good experience with tech communities with respect to both organizing and participating.

## Timeline
## Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
We are targeting to start meeting the new students who are starting this autumn at the orientation week other fresher activities in the month of September. 

# Planning for the Future
## When will you review the impact of your proposal?
I will review the impact at the end of the semester, so that I have had enough time to reflect and understand the community better.

## How will you measure success?
I will measure success based on the amount of new pwople we are successful in inducting into the group.

## How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
I will have the participants fill out a survey after every meetup or activity, and also encourage feedback at any time anyone wants.
