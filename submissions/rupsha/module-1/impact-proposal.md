# Impact Proposal

## Summary of communities needs

### Community Demographics and Communication

The community consists of women who study at the University of Helsinki and have opted to study Computer Science as their major or minor studies.

At the moment, we use IRC and email to communicate, but we are open to other forms of communications as well.

## Culture

We do not have a code of conduct yet, and we are working on it. We plan to have a strong code of conduct such that in the event differences and disagreements arise, we should have a good resolution mechanism.
We do not meet up very frequently owing to schedule issues, and I have a plan in mind to help us meet more often and help the community grow.

# Your Proposal

I want to allocate a specific area for our meetups, so that anyone who wants to code can use that area and also get to meet other people who are passionate about the same things that they are. I would also like to organize trips to different companies to create more incentive for people to join us.

## Timing
The best timing would be when the next semester starts, but before the exam periods begin in December. The orientation week would be a good time to get people up to speed on what we have been doing so far and our values.

## Goals
My goal is to get people interested to join our group and bring in some diversity so that it benefits all of us.

## Communication

As indicated earlier, we will continue to use IRC and emails unless someone points out a better communication channel.


# Proposal's Imapct

## Target Audience
I plan to impact people (mostly women students of the University of Helsinki) who aim to take their coding skills to an advanced level.
