# About me

Hi everyone! My name is Tal Davidi and I'm a student at the University of Maryland. Currently I'm a CS student like many of you in my third year (graduating 2019).

I am a part of the Bitcamp organizers community at our school where my first year I helped out with logistics by designing the floor plan and helping to plan food. Looking to join Tech this year to make the event as seamless as possible!

My favorite emoji is definitely the :thinking: emoji but I will have to go with :finnadie: since github does not support it :worried:.
