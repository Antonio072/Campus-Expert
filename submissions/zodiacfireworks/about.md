# Hi! I am Martín

## About me

Hi, my name is Martín Josemaría, [@zodiacfireworks](https://github.com/zodiacfireworks) at gihub. I love science, 
programming, pizza and makis. I also love cats but I don't have one for now :cry:. When I get the chance I like to
do trekking or travel to unknown places like very small towns in  the mountains. Sometimes, in my spare time, I read
novels by Isabel Allende. She is my favorite writer. I also like indie and relaxing music in any language.

## What I study

Fomaly, I study physical science at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru. I currently focused on computational physics, 
mainly applied to astrophysics.

I am also self-taught in programming, web development, computer science and data science.

## About my work

As a physicist I have been working for the Peruvian Space Agency in the Department of Astrophysics. I have also worked 
as a freelancer, making small web systems. This year I started my own tech company,
[@SoftButterlfy](https://github.com/softbutterfly/).

## Communities I participate in

The community in which I most actively participate is [HackSpace Perú](https://github.com/hackspaceperu/), 
where I am one of the main trainers in the area of web development. in HackSpace we seek to form a peer 
learning space about topics related to technology, as well as software like hadrware.

Another community where I am very active is LinuxAtUni, where we help students from any part of Peru to enter the 
world of Linux, mainly with the Fedora distribution and the GNOME desktop.

Other communities where I take part are Open Source CFD and Python Peru, this year we are organizing a PyDay in Lima. 
Fedora Peru, where currently I am training to be a software packer for Fedora Scientific.

I regularly attend meetups of other communities, such as Digital Ocean Lima, Lima Craftsmanship Software,
Data Science Lima, among others.

## Why I joined the GitHub Campus Expert training

I actively participate in the tech community in Lima and I learn a lot from that. I want to form a group of 
Computationational Physics at my faculty and show to my classmates where they can reach with tech skills and it's 
aplications to physical sciences. I help to promote it because they are missing out on a lot. Becoming a GitHub 
Campus Expert will help me in the goal of growing the tech community, especially among students of my university, 
in particular of my faculty.
