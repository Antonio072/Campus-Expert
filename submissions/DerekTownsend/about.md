Greetings my name is Derek Townsend and I am a sophmore at Illinois State University.

My major is Information Systems.

I am currently a Instructor at a small start up called CoderSpace.
At CoderSpace I help teach students how mostly how to build websites using HTML,CSS, and JS.

I have justed started learning Java as well so that I can have a better understanding of how backend languages work.

I actually strongly dislike emojis which is interesting considering the fact that I used to complain about how 
tone and emotion are hard to convey through texting.
