## About Me
Hey, I'm Tom (@tauomicronmu) and I'm a CompSci student at the University of Birmingham. I used to run the Computer Science Society, and I'm the lead organiser of HackTheMidlands =)

My aim is to really bring the Birmingham tech community together and pull away from it's fragmented state, following the example of amazing tech communities such as the one in Nottingham (TechNottingham etc.)

Tech-wise I'm an avid lover of Python, JavaScript and C, and also a big fan of lower-level stuff involving hardware and electrical engineering.
