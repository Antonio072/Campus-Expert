# Hello GitHub-World!

## Who I am
My name is Rafael, I am 26, and study electrical & communications engineering in Germany and work as intern in an engineering company,
that creates control & process measurement systems.
I always have been fascinated by PCs and electronics and I code since about 3 years, time which I spended to learn
as much as I could. 

I am from Madrid, Spain, and since 8 years I live in Germany. 

## What I love
Electronics, networks, science, sports, good food & drink, my family & of course code!

## Why I want to be a Campus Expert
I love the open-source community and love github, as well as the idea behind it. I want to learn more about it and about 
creating & managing a community. I love to spend my (little) knowledge and wand to be for active in hackathons and workshops, 
since I never could visit one before. Now I am planning to create one and also would be great to teach code to kids.
