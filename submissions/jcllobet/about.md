#About me
Hello, my name is Jan Carbonell and I am an Industrial Engineering recent graduate. 

I started the first entrepreneurship club of our university, UPC FoudersLab. 
I also fell in love with Hackathons (HackUPC) and I think that GitHub is a big enabler of that community. 

My favorite emoji is the:rocket: because it pushes you to above and beyond your own limitations.
