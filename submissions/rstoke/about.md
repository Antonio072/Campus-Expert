## About Maxime

Hi! I'm Maxime and I always have a hard time answering the question "Where do you come from?"

I traveled with my parents but I mainly grew up in Diego Suarez, Madagascar. 
I then studied the engineering curriculum MPSI/MP* in France, organized HackBordeaux, and I'll be now living in the US starting in September studying Computer Science in UC San Diego.

I am excited to finally be again in the international system, get involved and meet all of you Campus Experts!
 
## Interests

I'm passionate about traveling, learning and sharing experiences with people. 

Tech, math, physics but also education and environmental protection are subjects I've held dear since Madagascar.
I'm particularly interested in the way tech can be mixed with other fields and how we can have a positive impact on the world.  

Oh and I love windsurfing and watersports in general!

## Contacting Maxime

Really looking forward to learning about any kind of subjects and meeting all of you so feel free to reach out!
