#### About Me

Hi, my name is David and I'm a student at Rutgers University studying CS. I am the current marketing director for HackRU, where I take care of things like branding, design, social media, and advertising to get as much exposure for our hackathon as possible. My first experience with the hackathon/tech scene was, unsuprisingly, attending HackRU during the 2014/2015 season. I was glad to be around peers with the same interests and skills as me - it was a wonderful community to discover and be a part of.

#### Interests and Hobbies

I love playing volleyball, ping pong, and sometimes basketball. I really enjoy the outdoors (although I live in the city and seldom get the chance to escape) and don't mind a hike or two once in a while, and am also a fan of Silicon Valley, YouTube vlogs, and coffee.
