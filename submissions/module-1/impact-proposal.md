Summary:
	Our community needs more opportunities to interact with each other and engage with accessible, entry level tech. Barriers to this include imposter syndrome, and a community that is authentic and open about it might be the best way to address this (I am not sure what the best way to address this is).
	
	The community is made up of about 100 people, about twenty of these are a core group that come to e v e r y t h i n g. Most are undergrads, but about 25% are graduate students, which is awesome. Our community preferes in person meetings, and likes facebook more than emails, but also likes flyer advertisements and word of mouth. We announce our events before seminar classes sometimes, and that gets us a lot of freshmen.
	
	The existing culture is very divided. There are some people in the space who have already gone through many parts of the journey and are able to make lots of things and are confident that they can learn most things in 24 hours. There are also many people who know they don't know how to do these things and feel intimidated and less than these other people, and are about to begin their journey. Fortunately, the people who do know are generous with their time, but there is a general feeling of insecurity in many of the members.
	
Proposal:
	To focus on beginner "hackers" (people who code for fun and because they can) and bring these two groups together through workshops, hack nights, and an open culture focused on growing, with a dialogue about imposter syndrome. I am not really interested in increasing the size of the community, but since people graduated and more freshmen and transfer students come in I will continue to advertise all events. I think another thing I can do is also encourage other students and help them run their own workshops. 
	
	Goals:
		- host workshops/local hack nights to get beginners over the hump of "I have no idea what I'm doing"
		- engage the community by starting a discussion on imposter syndrome (maybe at a hacknight?)
		- give other students a platform to host their own workshops to share their knowledge and reach students with different interests as they learn practical application
		
	We in the past communicate with our facebook page and in person meetings, I like this because it gives an official space for people to talk and meet each other, leaving other forms of communication for private discussion between members as they link up with each other. It is hard to get that many people to join a slack when you don't talk about things daily.
	
Impact:
	Target audience is people who like to code on their own or want to learn how to make things. The majority of students at my school only learn theory, so there is a bit of a divide between people that hack, people that want to hack, and people that don't. I want to bridge the gap between the first two groups.
	
	Needs:
		- introduction to practical computer science in an accessible format
		- a space where students wanting to learn how to make things can meet and build together
		- a dialogue on imposter syndrome, because it is a big barrier in my community and prevents people from growing
	All of these are in the scope of the proposal of workshops and local hack days, although the imposter syndrome part might be hard to make a workshop.
	
		
	For formal programming, I want to do one workshop a month, plus at least one local hack night. This requires help, because in the past when I ran workshops with just one of my friends we spent a lot of time going to the people in the audience and helping them with their problems. This also requires content, and fortunately I have friends with some content as well as some knowledge that I learned at hackathons and my internships and just messing around. I spoke with my fellow hackathon organizers and four of us want to run workshops, which is a good team for this. We also have a room in our department building we can use. As far as funding goes, for snacks, we might have some budget from our hackathon left over, and we are reaching out to sponsors for next year anyway. I do need content on addressing imposter syndrome, I am having trouble finding information other than personal experiences. I will research the phenomenon, and ask friends in industry.
	
	I plan to deliver this through in person workshops and local hack days, because it gives people a chance to meet each other. I have found (and discussed with others) that when people are able to do whatever they are learning while the teacher is teaching them they are usually more successful. This is why I want to focus on the workshop format, with a github repository for the code if people want to look at it later and a slideshow.
	
	As far as content goes, I know about databases and applications well enough to do a workshop for beginners on learning how to integrate that. I don't know as much about machine learning, but one of the other people from my school interested in leading a workshop is and we are teaming up. Our team of four is interested in doing a workshop on deployment as well, something we have all done, and a repeat of the api workshop, because it is such a basic thing many people find intimidating.
	
	As far as the timeline, goes, holding a workshop once a month (September, October, November, December), maybe on different nights to reach people with different schedules will give people opportunities to meet and learn. I think additional events, like local hack day and a social would also help develop the community. The workshops will have content, and I will probably start with a website + api one, and then a database one, and then deployment, followed by machine learning.

Planning for the future:	
	I will review impact after each event through surveys. I also want to see if I can make/find a tool to monitor the GitHub accounts of people that come to workshops, to see if they become more active after workshops and look for general patterns, as well as rate the success of certain workshops against each other.
	
	There are some parts of community that are hard to measure, such as relationships between members. I will review this based on the mood of the room, and maybe random sampling of "how many people do you know here?"
	
	I will measure success if people become empowered to learn things on their own and share them. To do this, I will have to follow up with people, through surveys and when possible conversations. I will iterate on my plans every month, because that is the workshop cycle.
