Community Assessment

Definition:
  Current:
    - Student programmers from Boston University
    - Student makers - Boston University
    - More advanced coders of BU
    - People interested in both details of coding and tech scene as a whole
  Ideal:
    - All levels of coders from BU
    - Those interested in learning to code and need support to do so
  How to Improve:
     - Get rid of imposter syndrome! - make tech more friendly and welcoming to newbies
        - Advertise in classes, perhaps do live demonstrations
        - Utilize connections/friend network
     - Advertise undergraduate CS club community as a whole, perhaps organize a day to check out all the different CS clubs + organizations
     
Size:
  - Around 100 people currently, give or take 20. 
  - Ideally encompasses entire CS population of BU, including undergrads, masters, and PhD students. 
  - Has been growing recently, with addition of new clubs to overall club community. Many undergrads still alienated, however, as they are
    rising juniors/seniors, who have already grown accustomed to not having CS community behind their backs. Most recent and incoming 
    freshman classes are targets though, as they are more malleable and open to new opportunities.
  
Resources:
  - As of now, the 6 main clubs host weekly meetings, some of which will be workshop-based, and have a strong network of senior members who
    can help teach newer members.
  - Office hours are generally hosted by professors only; clubs don't host them, although they do host "coffee and code"-like sessions, so
    those who want to learn can come and get help from senior members. Planning to implement a mentorship program that pairs underclassmen
    with upperclassmen
  
Accessibility:
  - No childcare available; will be a problem once we expand to graduate communities, but may not as urgent as other matters currently
  - Anyone who wants to join, can join a club. However, for certain committees such as the hackathon organizing team, you have to apply
    and talk to the director. Main problem is probably advertising and getting rid of imposter syndrome.
  - Meetings are usually at night, and on weekends. Could hold morning meetings as well, to cater to those who may have activities at night
  
Interests:
  - Our community consists of computer science students and engineering students mostly. It would be nice to involve other communities,
    such as the business school, members of which would benefit greatly from a better understanding of tech and its intricacies
      - Could be accomplished by partnering with some business school clubs who emphasize tech, such as our BizTech club
  - Our community consists of various clubs, some focusing on "specific" topics like machine learning, others just on coding in 
    general, and some on promoting minorities in tech
  
Goals:
  - People get involved, usually as freshman, to become a part of a community and find friends with similar interests, and also to 
    develop their own technical skills - usually people who are in their early undergraduate years, and who are interested in finding
    internships, and so can utilize the connections and resources our community offers to do so
  - Everyone who joins our community is definitely passionate about coding, albeit to different degrees; most are extremely interested
    in continuously learning new technologies and honing their skills, though
  - 1. Open up community to all levels of coders by getting rid of imposter syndrome - promote inclusivity!
    2. Encourage graduate-level students ot join by implementing higher level workshops/discussions and mentorship program
    3. Mentorship programs and frequent workshops will help bridge the gap between more experienced coders and beginners
  
Location:
  - Currently gathering in the computer science building, which is somewhat shut off from the main campus; there is online presence,
    but not particularly well-advertised
  - Location is on campus; parking should not be too much of a problem - there are a few spaces, but the members are all college
    students; there are presentation rooms and multiple general-purpose rooms. All in all, physical meeting space is not a problem
    currently, although may need more once expansion occurs.
  
Communication:
  - Communication is done via Slack and Facebook, mostly; we have been shifting to Slack more, recently
  - Some clubs have GitHub organizations and mailing lists, while others don't - will need to implement lines of communication/project
    and idea sharing platforms that are appropriate for each club
  - Some clubs could definitely use things such as a GitHub organization, to increase publicity and showcase the cool projects their
    members have built as a part of the club
  
Culture: 
  - Our community always welcomes anyone and everyone who is interested in joining, as well as their ideas and ideas from current members
  - Disagreements don't occur often, but when they do, I often act as a mediator, trying to hear out both sides and giving my opinion - 
    usually resolves the conflict, but if not, I try to convince them to postpone it and talk about it another time.
  - Policies/procedures are not documented, to my knowledge. Some ground rules, as well as specific rules for different clubs would 
    definitely be helpful, though
  - My job will mostly consist of rallying existing members to be more open about their clubs, attracting new members. Also, perhaps
    creating a small team to hash out logsitics regarding solid documentation for various rules will be a boon and good investment for
    recruitment.
