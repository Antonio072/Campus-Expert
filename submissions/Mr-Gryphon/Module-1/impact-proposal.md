We also planning, their are so many hackathon that are conducted by different community. we try to be part of them.

Your Proposal's Impact

Target audience New and current students at JECRC university
Start collecting the information related to different hackathon, also connecting with the experts for their classes.

Planning for the Future

The main way that I can measure the success of the proposal is by judging the numbers of DevSoc members. This wonâ€™t be something I can measure quickly as some people might stop attending. We are planning on having events at least once a term, as well as advertising the society in person once a term. This is in the hope that by reminding people that we are there will encourage them to attend and take part in the society. We will measure this by looking at the numbers of people attending the events as well as people actively taking part in online discussions.
