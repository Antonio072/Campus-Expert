Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change

Yes!! the group always been of same size.

Resources

What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?

In JECRC University we always get a new opportunity to learn new things . There are a lot of meet ups around the area which accommodate different tech interests and skill levels. As a society we tend to take part in different hackathon that is run by a local community, Goverment and colleges. There are a few other hackathons that we take place in although they tend to be national or world wide as travelling to other places for hackathons can be difficult. As students we have a lot of support from our teachers and lecturers and can often go to them for help and extra information. We have clases related to different things. 

Accessibility

How accessible are the current resources in your community?

The resources in the society are, for the most part, easily available. we really get supports from our mentors they guide us for different different things, and are availabe as needed.

Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?

For the most part the meetings are held when people wont be working, or if we have some new ideas and would like to share.Generally we have 2 meetings in a month,  For those that can't attend we keep meeting notes which they can access as well as summarising the meeting on Facebook.

Interests

Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?

Our society is mostly made up of students studying computer science related topics. We are not Ok with it as a students we neead to learn lots of things. we also trying to includes students from different branches that can share their knowledge in the community and will help others alsoo to learn so many things. As we have included students from different branch like mechanical also . :)  

Location

Where does your community currently gather?

Currently our group gathers at the JECRC Campus, in the room that has been given to us. Information is also on the Facebook page and we are currently working on a website. There is parking for the students, but only is they have a parking permit for the student car park. Because the meeting room is on campus there is plenty of transport too and from the city to the campus. There is no charge to members of the society for the use of the space or membership to the society. Although we tend to use the same room we do have the option of booking other, large rooms, should we need to. The main DevSoc room can hold about 15 people and contains 10 computers. Most of the time there is water and snacks available.
If the number of people is more than 50 we conduct a meetup where we invite other members also from different opensource community and share our thoughts and ideas. 
On Oct 08,2017 we have a session on Android and Kotline and different programs by google and other opensource community like mozila. :) 

Communication

How does your community get in touch with one another?

There are a few ways for the society to get in touch with each other. The main way is through the Slack group or through Facebook. However, we do have an email address and a twitter account, if that form of communication is easier for the member. Our organisation would benefit from being more active on these, which is something we are aiming to do and encourage next year.

Culture

We meet with new peoples in meetups or any events like hackathon.
we share our thoughts and leran from them, they share their ideas experience with us, that help us.
We have a form that to be filled by the new people that help in manage the data and information about them, I personally guide the new members about the different ideas. I am good in machine learning, competitive coding help them if they have some errors or some issue, and many more.
