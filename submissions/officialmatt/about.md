# About Matt

Hello I'm Matt - about to be 3rd year Computer Science student at UCL. I'm currently working as an intern at Rightmove where I'm learning all sorts of Java wizardry and how to tell people that I don't sell houses.

Im also the Vice President of UCL TechSoc having been promoted from my position of Socials Director last year. I will be working over the next few months to help organising our Hackathons Porticode and HackLondon as well as all the other awesome stuff we do :smiley: 

## Interests

I like to learn things that I don't know - next on my list is Django. When I'm not doing something tech related I like to watch Crystal Palace most likely lose in :soccer: or bake something from Bake Off.
