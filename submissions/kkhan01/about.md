# About Khinshan

Hi! I'm Khinshan (feel free to call me Shan, I don't really have a preference), and I'm a rising senior at Stuyvesant High School. 
I'm an organizer for StuyHacks, and I made StuyHacks my first hackathon experience. I plan to pursue CS in college.

## Interests

I love technology: both software and hardware. I enjoy taking innovative approaches at problems, because in those small detours, you 
may find something worthwhile. Although CS is my foremost favorite, I dabble in various different areas. Feel free to hit me up on any 
debate topics, science, math, English, or anything. During my free time (outside of CS), I like to play video games, watch tv shows/ 
anime, read, and explore my city/ urbex.

I tend to use emoji depending on the website (they tend to look different), but I like using :heart_eyes:
