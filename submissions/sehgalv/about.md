## Hello! 
My name is Vishakha Sehgal. I am a junior Computer Science student at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA (RVA).
I am super excited to use the GitHub campus experts program as a platform to bring our technology community to RVA and VCU!

## Organizations
I am an organizer for RamHacks, and am currently working on setting up a mentorship program within my CS department for incoming students. I am also a brother of Theta Tau, a professional engineering fraternity. 

## Favorite Emoji
My favorite emoji would have to be ðŸ˜‚, because who doesn't love a good laugh!
