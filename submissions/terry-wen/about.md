Hi everyone!

My name is Terry Wen, and I am currently a senior studying Computer Science and Finance at Arizona State University.

I am a founder of the hackathon Desert Hacks, and am actively looking for ways to build upon my local student tech community. I've attended collegiate hackathons around the country, and also enjoy participating in coding competitions. 

Outside of coding, I dedicate much of my free time to music and video games. I also like trying new foods and sometimes attempting to make my own.

The best emoji is the watermelon emoji. üçâ
