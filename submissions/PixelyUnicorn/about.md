# About @PixelyUnicorn

I'm Victor Lourng, and I'm currently studying CS at Temple University.

I do web development/design for a living and I am the lead organizer of [CodeDay Philly](http://codeday.org/philly).

My favorite things in life are :taco: and javascript. I love them so much that I run a meetup called [TacoJS](https://tacojs.rocks/)!
