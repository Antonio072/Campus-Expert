Hello! I am a junior studying computer science at University at Buffalo. This is the 3rd year I've been a part of our school's ACM student chapter, and am elected president for this year. UB ACM has been an integral part of my path of becoming a software engineer, and I would love to be able to inspire to my junior members just like how my seniors did for me.

My goal is to build tools that can improve people's lives. As a software engineer, I love being a part of the process in the creation of a new project, from conceptualization to production to deployment. I hope I can make an impact using my technical knowledge to solve problems people face everyday.
