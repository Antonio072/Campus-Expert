<h3>Myself in a nutshell</h3>

Artsy coder, I am enthusiastic of the human side of technology and a student of the science of Human Computer Interaction within the School of Computer Science at University of Manchester. I am looking for broadening my ability to emphasise humanity using machines, lately interested in using UX and VR in this intent.  


<h3>About VR</h3>

At the moment, it has a great potential to change people's perception over how to interact with technology. Think about all the games, 360Â°  movies and Google's Tilt Brush.

But I think these are only a fragment of what VR and AR can actually do. What about creating 3D models of the human body for Medicine students to learn on? They could even be used in surgeries! Universe maps for astronomers, the dream vacation in the tourism industry, scenarios to combat mental illnesses such as PTSD, simulation environments for workers in the heavy industry...so many ways these technologies can help!

And I am not done. What if we combine this visual experience with the stimulation of other senses? <a href= "http://janegauntlett.com/inmyshoesproject/"> Taste, for example, to experience how it feels to have an epileptic attack. </a>

It is, truly, a limitless virtual world.
