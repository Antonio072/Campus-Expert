# About Me

Hello everyone!  My name is Cody Ley-Han and I am a computer science student 
at UCLA.  I am external vice president of a new developement club on campus
called DevX and am also the director of technology for LA Hacks.  My current 
main focuses are developing my craft and helping to grow the tech community
here at UCLA.

# Current Programming Obssesion

```go
package main

import fmt


func main() {
    fmt.Println("I love Go!");
}

## Interests

When I am not spending my time learning some new technology (I do fullstack if you were wondering), I can sometimes be heard playing ukelele.  I also am a big fan of saltwater fish tanks and riding my bicycle.
