# Learning Goals

* Understanding why you would use LinkedIn to find opportunities

* Review LinkedIn tools such as finding alumni
* Review how to populate your profile

# Discussions and Pairing Opportunities

* Ask those who have LinkedIn profiles already to match with another and review each other's profiles
* For those who don't have profiles, ask them to go through the creation process together
* Do a round robin style of interaction for the audience to connect with each other

# Recovery Points

* For those who fall behind, an "expert" will guide them to get them caught up
* Breaks will occur after every segment with Q/A
* Each part of this workshop is independent of the previous and next parts

# Participatory Learning

* Ask them to rate a profile
* Ask why you would use LinkedIn
* Ask what makes LinkedIn different to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
* Prompt the audience with pictures and posts and ask which ones are appropiate

# Adapting to Your Participants

* Is the audience on LinkedIn?
* Are they asking relavant questions or any questions at all?
* Are people keeping up with the material?
* If people are behind, have backup or time allocated on each section
