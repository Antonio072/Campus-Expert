# Community Overview

UC Riverside is home to many student organizations. We have organizations who focus on recreational activities such as Taiko Drumming to engineering such as the Association of Computing Machinery. Each of these organizations have similar missions and difficulties such as creating a collaborative environment and increasing membership.

# My Favorite Organizations

* The Association of Computing Machinery
  * A computer science organization who hosts professional and technical development events
* Citrus Hack
  * Hosts a beginner oriented 12-hour hackathon and a competitive 36-hour hackathon
* The Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers
  * Has projects from electric car to micromouse
* The Society of Women Engineers
  * Has tons of outreach events
* Cross Campus Entrepreneurs
  * An organization to learn how to develop one's entrepreneurial skills

# The Current State

Many of these organizations act on their own accord. Because of that, there are duplication in efforts. Two organizations could be holding resume feedback sessions back to back when they could be combining to make an even bigger resume feedback session.


# The Future

I want all of the above organizations along with the many that I did not mention to collaborate more. With such similar goals, a combined effort would surely result in a bigger outcome.
