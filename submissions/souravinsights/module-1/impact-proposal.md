## Summary of the Community's Needs

 [Emisha](https://www.facebook.com/getemisha/), It is an independent community, it's not limited to only our college but it is getting it's shadow every where around Bhubaneswar. The main reason why I started this community is because I belong to a school where computer education was secondary and Rote learning was the primary thing, so I don't want my fellow students to face the same. My community's primary goal is to spread the computer education awareness through out every Regional schools and help students in rural areas of Odisha to gain a strong knowledge in Computers. We're trying to reach our to the unreached parts of odisha.
 
## Your Proposal

We propose a series of workshops, seminars, and lightning talks that are to be held twice every month aimed at introducing beginners to basic tools that are used regularly at hackathons so they are better armed to face the danger.
The workshops will be on a diverse range of topics starting right from Git to deploying a web app for everyone to use to integrating machine learning into their project.
The lightning talks and seminars would cover similar topics and would be focused more on the theory rather than hands-on experience, because a solid understanding is also required.

- **Timing**: These events will be held twice a month and will build upon each other leading up to the hackathon so beginners are more prepared for the hackathon.
- **Community demographics**: These events are aimed at freshmen who are just starting school. But we really want everyone who wants to try their hands at developing software to be welcome. We can probably do that by putting up posters in hallways and spreading information with the help of the school. We can also make them more aware of such events by asking the professors who are teaching Intro to Computing classes to give a shout our/blurb about these events - maybe even team up with a professor to provide extra credits for those who attend these workshops.
- **Goals**: Our main goal is to make hackathons beginner friendly and less intimidating. However, as hackathons become larger, the intimidation naturally arises from the large number of attendants. So this proposal corrects that deviation by preparing beginners and arming them with the essential knowledge that they would have to learn on their own (because simple things like Git are not taught in classes). Since there are other beginners in the room, they will feel more welcome and less intimidated by the scale of things.
- **Communication** - Our main mode of communication will remain WhatsApp or Facebook. But we will also start a mailing list and Gitter Channel for all beginners so they are upto date on events going on in campus. We will use the mailing list to notify them about other hackathons that we feel they should go to. We are starting a blog on Medium (along with a public GitHub repo) where we will document what goes on during each of these workshops so students can always go back to review topics they forgot or missed.

## Your Proposal's Impact

- Target audience
  - The target audience for our workshops and seminars will be for beginners who are looking to try coding, freshmen, sophomore as well as other branch students.
  - We want more people to join the community irrespective of whether they are in STEM field or not.

- Community needs
  - Making hackathons (and software development in general) less intimidating and more welcoming to beginners.

- Resources
  - An event space for conducting these workshops - I can take permission to host our event in our Auditorium or Seminar Hall in our college, we can also use [**KIIT TBI**](http://www.kiitincubator.in/) for our events for free if they grant us the permission.
  - Reaching out to beginners interested in tech - asking the college for emails; putting up posters; and spreading the word with the help of professors is the way to go.
  - Ideas for workshop topics - lots of brainstorming with team members, probably do a survey of what beginners think they need for a hackathon.
  - Speakers and presenters - This will mostly be done by our team, But in our list we also have some list of popular software professionals of Mindfire, and some GDG Members

- Media
  - The plan to deliver the content is probably through slideshows that will later be uploaded to a public GitHub repo for everyone to view
  - We also plan to document the workshop into a blog post for our (upcoming) Medium blog for students to go back and review
  - There will also be a mailing list, [Gitter channels](https://gitter.im/getemisha/Lobby), and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Emisha/) for communication
  - We might also video record the workshops and talks and upload them to YouTube.

- Content knowledge
  - I'm not so good at giving public talks but, I think I'm pretty good at explaining about any technical topics.
  - The topics that will be covered in the workshops will be on basic topics that at least one person on our team is well versed on. In case that fails, we will probably ask someone else, like a professional, teacher, or another student, who has good experience working with that tool.

- Timeline
  - The workshops will be conducted twice a month and will lead up to the hackathon.
  - The workshops will be interspersed with seminars or lightning talks
  - The workshop's time duration will varify as per the requirment.

## Planning for the Future

- We will measure success based on the number of people who show up during each workshop.
- We might also ask them to fill out surveys to see how they feel about the event.

- The frequency of iterating the community plans will depend on how many people show up to the workshops.
- If the workshops attract a good number of audience, the proposal will continue to be the same until our hackathon ends.
