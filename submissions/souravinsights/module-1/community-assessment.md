## Introduction 
I'm a student of [Gandhi Institute for Technological Advancement](http://www.gita.edu.in/), Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. In our area, the comminity activities have 
been given less priority. Students are limliting their exposure within the academic syllabus. Actually they don't get exposure of the real 
world of Computer Science. But outside in Bhubaneswar other colleges like [KIIT University](http://kiit.ac.in/), [CET](https://www.cet.edu.in/) the community activies are always given the priority. Students of those universities are always active in events
like Hackathons, Workshops and every other tech events. When I was in second year of my academic carieer I got exposed to one of this event
accidentaly. Then I got so attracted to it that I  never missed any single event those are within my exposure. I then got introduced to 
two of the active comminity in Odisha i.e, [**Google Developer Group Bhubaneswar**](https://www.gdgbbsr.com/) and [**Microsoft Dev Community Odisha**](https://www.facebook.com/MsdcOdisha/). I started voluneering                               
in these communities. I got so involved to it that I end up creating my own community, [**Emisha**](http://getemisha.com/). It is an independent community, 
it's not limited to only our college but it is getting it's shadow every where around Bhubaneswar. `The main reason why I started this 
community is because I belong to a school where computer education was secondary and Rote learning was the primary thing, so I don't
want my fellow students to face the same.` My community's primary goal is to spread the computer education awareness through out every
Regional schools and help students in rural areas of Odisha to gain a strong knowledge in Computers. We're trying to reach our to the
unreached parts of odisha.

## Size

- Our community has 10 core members and a network of approximately 100 students. Our reach can be extendable because recently we've colaborated with Microsoft Dev Community Odisha which has a larger network because it's umbrella comapany is Mindfire. 
  People from different communities are getting involved to our community.
- Our comunity is open to everyone who has a williingness to learn and passionate about tech. We also welcome those students who don't even belong to computer science so that can be a part of diverse network.

## Resources

As I have already mentioned that we've collaborated with Microsoft Dev Community Odisha, in which all the members are IT professionals and Software Engineers. They do come to our events as speakers to talk about new emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning etc. 
 
- Venue :
    - We have access to our college's seminar Hall where we can organise these events.
    - We have access to KIIT Technology Business Incubator where we can organise workshops and Hackathons,  KIIT - TBI has provided a vibrant ecosystem for promoting innovations and entrepreneurship development.

    known place.
 
 ## Interests

- We like to welcome anyone interested in technology
- Students from other branch like ECE, EEE because we also organise workshops related to Robotics, Arduino, Manual Robots, RC Plane, Quadcopter which
  is good for both of the branch.    
- We also give chance to students who wants to share their knowledge on any field.

## Goals
- The main goal is to reach out to the unreached. We're planning to organise events in Rural Schools of Odisha. We want to reach as many schools as possible. 
- We've divided the group in different sectors like: Designing Team, Programming Team, Campus Representatives, Organizing Team etc. 
  Every sector has a lead who guide the team to work effectively to achieve their goals.
- Women participation in the tech activities is slightly inclined but recently due to [**Women Techmakers Group**](https://www.facebook.com/wtmbbsr/), they are showing more interest. The ratio is still very low but we expect it'll grow in near future. 
- Few students are passionate about developing regardless of their major.
- More frequent talks, events to get everyone involved in tech related activities.
