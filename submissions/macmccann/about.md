# About Mac

Hi, my name is Mac McCann and I'm a rising sophomore and hopeful GitHub campus expert from Brown University!

### On Campus
The things I like to do on campus include athletics and hiking/outings.

### Off Campus
Off campus, I like to write code, especially full-stack web apps. I'm writing a web application called [Auxify](http://auxify.us) that provides turn-based music playing. I make music in my spare time, and I really enjoy being in nature and hanging out with friends.

### Professional Experience
I'm currently interning for a data engineering startup called [Astronomer](astronomer.io). Previously, I have interned at a company called [Hobsons](hobsons.com) and have freelanced to develop several personal websites.
