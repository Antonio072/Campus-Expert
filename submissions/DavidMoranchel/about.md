<h2> Hello everyone </h2> 
<h4 style=> My name is David Cerme√±o Moranchel, I am a student of Computer Engineering at UNAM (Mexico), I am one of the leaders of the community of GDG UNAM (Google Developers Group) and work of web developer.

I am passionate about being part of a community, since the sense and the desire of all in it create a fantastic atmosphere where they propose incredible things.

Among my hobbies are taking pictures of all the places I visit (including my surroundings), going out with my friends and learning something new.

I love dogs (especially the basset hound) :dog:

My favorite emoji is: :octocat:
