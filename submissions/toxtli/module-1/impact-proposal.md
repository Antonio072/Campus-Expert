## Summary of the Community's Needs

- **Community demographics**: Currently we are 17 members in total, 9 women and 8 men. We have students deom different levels, from High School to PhD. We have a laboratory in which the members can go whenever they want and in that place we meet weekly.  Most of the students are from Computer Science.
- **Communication**: Right now we are known because the professors invite their students to participate. We maintain contact by Slack.
- **Culture**: We are a group in which members can learn, meet, collaborate and contribute in the areas that are related to Human-Computer Interaction.


## Your Proposal

- **Timing**: Events will happen at the beginning of the semester or after conferences & journals deadlines, usually these times work better for undergraduate and graduate students.
- **Community demographics**: Each semester we have more members since professors are inviting their students to join. But we are also thinking other strategies like internal emailing, social media announcements, etc.
- **Goals**: The main goal is to give visibility to the university in the top HCI conferences and journals by publishing novel content there. If we want to achieve that we need to vinculate the professors with students to help them to propose, build and deploy novel applications that can result on interesting papers. Following that process we will help people to learn and to be recognized in the global HCI communities.
- **Communication**: Frequently stand-up meetings in which we present advances and teach others about our new findings have been very effective to get more people involved. During the week they use Slack to coordinate between them. Some of the users start with personal projects and others start joining an existing project.


## Your Proposal's Impact

- Target audience
  - Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal?
	  - Students from High School to PhD level
- Community needs
  - What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
	  - The HCI area was missing in our university and is difficult to be recognized as a strong HCI institution if all efforts are isolated. Collaborating between members can help to peer review our work, learn from others, and collaborate generating stronger contributions to the area. 
- Resources
  - What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
	  - We have the physical space, but we need some help in the diffusion. We don't know who are all the people working in HCI projects right now.
  - How will you obtain those resources?
	  - Maybe by inviting everyone and see who of them are interested in learning and who of them want to participate in a project.
- Media
  - How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
	  - In the professors' classes that has resulted very effective and internal emailing.
  - What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
	  - Prepare the semester agenda, invite people and ask them since the beginning what they want to learn or contribute.
- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
	  - I'm knowledgeable, this is my area of expertise.
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
	  - A Medium channel, tha Slack and the pshysical space.
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
	  - It is already done for this semester, it is all the Thursdays at 12pm we have this quick stand-up, and I'm planning to have monthly meet-ups.
  - If you are presenting content, identify the timing of your presentation.
	  - Not more than 20 minutes each.

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
	- Monthly
- How will you measure success?
	- Number of members, number of projects, number of publucations.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
