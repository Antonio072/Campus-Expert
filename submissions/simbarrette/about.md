# Hi there! :wave:
My name is Simon Barrette, and I'm a French Canadian studying **Software Engineering** at **Polytechnique Montréal**.

## My involvement:
* **Programming mentor** and member of the alumni community amongst the *First Robotic Competition* for more than 7 years. 
* **Advisor** on the Board of Directors of the *Polytechnique Student Association* (AEP).
* **Vice-President Machine** for the *2017 Engineering Games Committee*.

## Other wonderful stuff
* I strangely look exactly like this emoji: :person_with_blond_hair:!
* Being a **photographer**, I started my own production and publicity marketing agency based on my passion :movie_camera:.
* Being a huge fan of Git (and GitHub), I cut a deal with my professor and implemented the necessary support so we could
  switch from SVN to Git! Yay! Finally!
* I'm a very social creature :monkey_face:! Please come and talk with me! Ask me about **travel** and **architecture**! 

## If you're planning on coming to Montréal, read this!!
