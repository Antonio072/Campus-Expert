Organizations
I have been working at Association of Computing Machinery Women Chapter NUST as Vice Chairperson and have previosuly worked at IEEE Women in Engineering Branch.

Github Campus Expert Program

I think it will be a great opportunity for me to expand the github communty on my campus and to promote open access.
