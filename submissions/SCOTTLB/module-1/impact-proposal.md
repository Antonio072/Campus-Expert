Impact Proposal
===============
Author: SCOTTLB

## Summary of the Community's Needs
The proposal covers all members of ENUSEC (~50 students currently) but also aims to target all the students at ENU who have an interest in tech and cybersecurity. Students range from 1st year undergrads to PhD researchers and we also incorporate lectures into our community.

We communicate through our weekly and monthly social events as well as online through Discord.

The existing culture at ENUSEC is thriving with students willing and excited to improve themselves and their skillsets. People are willing to both teach others and learn from others, constantly bouncing ideas off one another.

## My Proposal
I would organise a range of informal workshops based around Git, GitHub and collaboration tools. Many people within our community lack understanding or knowledge of git and GitHub and I feel this would be a great way for me to share my skillset. We are really trying to promote a 'hacklab' esq environment at ENUSEC and being able to effectively use collaboration tools will not only allow our members to more efficiently work on projects together but also encourage others to be part of a team, working together to achieve a shared goal. 
Due to other time commitments, these wouldn't be huge scale workshops, but rather informal, chill sessions that I would hold at one of ENSUECS weekly meets. 

I'd also aim to generate more talks, CTFs and workshop opportunities for our members through the academic year. Bringing in outside speakers has proved successful in the past and I’d be looking to do this again. 

Collaborating with other societies as also provided great opportunities for our members (An example of this being when the Napier University Developer Society brought in Joe Nash to give an introduction to GitHub) allowing cross discipline knowledge sharing. 

We share all events through our Discord, Twitter and Eventbrite platforms as well as being advertised on the ENU official twitter accounts and posters around campuses.

## My Proposal's Impact
+ Target audience
  + I’m expecting to impact any ENU student who has an interest in the events, regardless of course
+ Community needs.
  + With my informal workshops I'd be directly addressing the lack of knowledge about collaborative platforms and their use. With the other events I'd organise it would address my communities need for learning and self improvement.
+ Resources
  + All resources needed are already in place for the proposed actions. Any additional resources required would be gained by seeking funding from ENU and local companies.
+ Media
  + My workshops would be delivered in a relaxed environment based around a presentation outlining guides, knowledge items and concepts that I would be conveying. Peer review of my workshops content will allow me to prepare further.
+ Content knowledge
  + I already have a good base understanding of git and GitHub and there is lots of learning resources available online.
+ Timeline  
  + Start of Trimester: Develop workshop draft outline 
  + 2 weeks: Create workshop final draft
  + 2 weeks: Draft run-through of workshops
  + 1 week: Run workshop, collect feedback, work on ideas for a more advanced workshop to build on from this one
  + Start of Trimester: Develop second workshop, use feedback and suggestions from first workshop to develop this
  This is by no means the end, should interest be high enough there's the possibility of starting a Git user group, organising larger scale workshops and more events. ENUSEC would continue to grow and develop as there’s always new things to learn and share with each other.

## Planning for the Future
A proposal review I’ll be done at the end of the second trimester to allow time for all proposed action to happen. Success will be determined based on satisfaction from workshops and events, attendance and new members joining.

If successful I aim to run varied workshops based on git and GitHub concepts, these will cover different areas depending on the workshop.
