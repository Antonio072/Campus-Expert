Community Assessment
====================
Author: SCOTTLB

## My community definition 
My community would be defined as a group of ENU students on a variety of different computing related courses ranging from computer science and creative computing through to cybersecurity and digital forensics who are all interested in computer security and ethical hacking. We all join together under the name [ENUSEC](http://enusec.org)

## How big is my community?
At present my community has reached 50 members, this is an amazing and positive change for us. When ENUSEC first started three years ago the member base was much smaller at around 5 members, last year we grew to 20 members and now we have grown to 50! This change has been brought on by the hard work and dedication we have put in to providing a friendly open platform for all ENU students to participate in and learn from. Organising events has been a huge part of the growth process for us.

## What resources do we have?
We are fortunate enough to be supported by ENU and have been able to slowly build up our resources to benefit our members. We have access to a growing server rack where we have our own private cloud for community members to create projects with. There is also a variety of hardware we have purchased as a society thats freely usable by all members. We run a variety of large events from CTFs and Hackathons through to webinars that regularly attract 70+ people.

## How accessible are we?
My community focuses on being open and available for all. Resources are always available to all our members, who pay a small membership fee to cover costs. Our weekly meetings are scheduled at a time when no undergraduate lecture run and there is a small gap in the postgraduate timetable, allowing both undergrads and post grads to attend. For anyone who works during this time we hold events and meet ups once a month at the weekend providing multiple times for everyone to get involved.

## What are we interested in?
Being a cybersecurity based society this is our main focus however as computing is a very wide subject area and we are open to other aspects such as software development, networking and information security. We are composed of anyone with an interest not only computing students.

## What are our goals?
Our goals are to bring together people with a similar interest and create a fun, relaxed and social environment for everyone to be part of whilst we also try to set our members up for the best possible future, by creating a reputation that members of ENUSEC are proactive and employable.

## Where can you find us?
Our weekly meet up are held on campus, which is easily accessible by public transport or walking/cycling and there is some parking close by. The space is free for us to use and has seating space and computers for 40 people. Our space has two projection screens allowing us to show webinars, presentations and online content to all members. As we are located in the city centre thereâ€™s a tonne of food shops located right by campus, we also have on campus coffee shops and canteens as well as free water fountains through the buildings

## How do we talk to each other?
We are very active on social media, we have a twitter account [@_enusec_](https://twitter.com/_enusec_) and a [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/enusec) page. We are constantly online on our [Discord](http://discord.enusec.org) chat platform. We use a [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ENUSEC) for any group projects our members would like to work on.

## Our community culture
As our goals outline, we want to bring people together. We welcome anyone and everyone to join us and pick up new skills or teach others their skills. ENUSEC operates on a committee based structure of which I am a part, should any disagreement come up we would deal with this a committee, looking at what impact is has towards the society and its members and vote on a decision. Personally I find that voting and compromise is the best solution to handle disagreements as I feel this is the fairest method for all parties
