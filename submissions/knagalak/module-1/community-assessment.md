# Assessing Your Community's Needs

## Definition
How would you define your community? 
- STEM students in the mid-west region

How many people are currently in your community?
- About 30,000 students 

How many would you like to be in your community?
- I would not want to be remebered for the school that I attend. I wish people would remember my school when they think of me. I wish to make a difference in my community.

Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
The group almost always remains the same.

## Resources

What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
- The believe the CS community at Purdue is strong. At the moment I am a part of Mentoring for Aspiring Girls in Computer Science, Computer Science Women's Network and Purdue Hackers. I personally mentor kids in Tech over the weekends.

## Accessibility

How accessible are the current resources in your community?
- In my opinion, I feel the program caters to only students around the area. I wish to start programs for adults who wish to learn a skill or two.

## Interests

Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
- In my opinion, most of the students have some experience in programming beacuse of the school's policy to take atleast one CS course while completing your bachelors. But most of my friends think of CS as a complex subject. I feel this needs to be tackled. 

## Communication

How does your community get in touch with one another?
- Social Media and the University website happen to be the main source of communication among students.

## Culture

How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
- Purdue has a dynamic community of students willing to make a difference in the community. 

What happens if there is a disagreement? Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented? How will you personally handle it?
- Purdue has a system in place to deal with such issues. This shouldn't be a problem in my opinion.
