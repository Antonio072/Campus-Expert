# Write a talk proposal

My talk proposal is the following. :smiley:

>## Create a Twitterbot in 30 minutes!
>From supporting us in the administration of social media accounts by giving automatic answers, to the realization of more elaborated processes; bots are relevant to us, as they automate tasks that will eventually simplify future work. In this *lightning* ⚡️ workshop (only 30 minutes) we will learn how to create a very basic bot on Twitter using Python, to automatically tweet phrases from a list of statuses, and quotes directly from a book.
>For this workshop you will only need basic knowledge about Python programming and about the basic usage of Twitter. The idea is that after taking the workshop, you will get more interested to enter into the world of bots for tasks automation.

I'd appreciate any feedback on my talk proposal! 😀🙌🏼

PS. This was actually a submission on papercall for the past [PythonDay Mexico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0VWnm9CAyE&feature=youtu.be), you can find the repo with material I created [here](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/Twitterbot_en_30).
