# GitHub Pages

I considered creating a community's website (I'm now looking forward to get a custom domain) from one of the jekyll themes found in [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/), more specifically from [https://github.com/ShawnTeoh/matjek](https://github.com/ShawnTeoh/matjek). (You can see a live demo of their website [here](https://shawnteoh.github.io/matjek/).)

Work done:
- The link to the GitHub Pages I built is: [https://rodolfoferro.github.io/futurelab/](https://rodolfoferro.github.io/futurelab/)
- The GitHub repo to the community's site is: [https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/futurelab](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/futurelab)
