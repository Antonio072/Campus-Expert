## Assessing Your Community's Needs


### Definition

Right now, I'm co-founder and leader of a student group (called **future·lab**) that mainly focuses on creating events  in which:
* We develop awesome sci-tech based projects that help society. For this, we need to constantly update our knowledge and skills.
* We teach other students how to program not caring about what they're studying, we have created workshops for different academic areas in our university. **This is possible throught collaborations we already have with other student groups.**
* We give an approach to nowadays technology topics and projects for students through tech-talks, conferences, coaching, and mentoring.

We are a diverse student community that works on the future that we think we need, by developing sci-tech based projects. Since we're a multidisciplinary diverse group, we are very open to new people and ideas that may improve our ecosystem or society in general. We are also a very collaborative community.

### Size

We are around 100 students interested in developing new technologies, new tools, or simply interestend in learning about our nowadays tech world. It would be great to get expanded to other divisions, in order to have more and more presence at the university. A goal number of people to be reached as part of our community (for a first phase) would be to double the number, i.e. around 200 students. This would be for an **ideal version of our current community** in a first phase.

The group has been growing because we have been aquiring more presence in our university recently. Members of our community have won a [national hackathon](http://www.ugto.mx/campusgto/noticias-gto/2241-estudiantes-de-la-universidad-de-guanajuato-ganan-primer-lugar-en-el-hackaton-cfox-2017), and with this, more students have been interested in get involved with the tech community where we belong. This students want to learn to program and to develop relevant tech projects that might solve social problems; which is one of the main goals of the community. Having more pepole getting interest because of this kind of success stories would also be part of our **ideal community**.

A way to improve to become our ideal commmunity is by reaching possitively to more students, so we can grow our number, events, quality of events, etc.

### Resources

We are already working on a set of (basic) programming workshops for people external to our community. A lot of people from different and very diverse careers have shown interest and have asked us for this workshops. Besides this, we monthly have a tech talk for our community.

A great advantage is that we're fully supported by our university, so we have access to several resources, such as spaces to implement any event, the official UG's social media channels to reach people for our events, and support from other student communities/groups for projects/events collaborations.

For our **ideal community** it would be great to extend the number of activities/events and resources to reach to more students and grow our community. For this we could organize a calendar, material, activities, etc. (as described in our impact proposal).

### Accessibility

As I've already mentioned, we are already fully supported boy our university in order to realiza any event. We already create accessible events (aroud ~1 hour of duration) for the student community, i.e. we try to do the events on hours that we know most of students are not having classes.

### Interests

Our community is not only made of computer science students, but of design students, marketing students, and more. Particularly I'm a mathematics student, working on my thesis about machine learning + computer vision + thermal image processing. A great thing about our community is that as part our philosophy, we try to integrate a diverse multidisciplinary community, so we can develop very integral projects. 

An important thing about our community is that even by being diverse, we are focused on working on sci-tech projects, so many of our student members are computer-careers-related students.

We are very open to many topics that may feed our knowledge, oportunities, etc.

### Goals

Students are interested on getting involved to our community because most of them want to learn tools, techniques, and knowledge –in general– that will let them develop sci-tech based projects for personal and social usage.

Most of them are students trying to get a degree, but with the particular interest to get an integral formation for their profession. So, this makes most of them passionate students for learning and developing cool projects with awesome ideas, regardless their bachelor's area.

Based on our existing goals, we might improve by creating more events having on mind our main community goals:

- (Monthly) Tech talks/conferences (~1 hour)
- (Monthly) Project night (~3 hours)
- (Bimonthly) Workshops (~2 hours)

### Location

Our community currently gathers in classrooms from different buildings in different divisions of our campus. This is to be diverse also in spaces and not only centered on computer science department classrooms. We also have realized events on auditoriums of the university.

All the locations are accessible for all the community, with free parking lots and also reachable by public transortation. This events and places are also accessible for people off campus.

All of our spaces are used for free, since we have our university support for these events. This allows us to be flexible with the people, organization of the event, the space and the type of event. Depending of the event, with this consideration of full support of our university, we can fit as much people as we plan in our event realization.

A cool thing about support by our university is that in some of our events (not in all) we can get beverages or snacks for attendees. Anyways, we always try to make events neraby to food places (as the caffeteria), and bathrooms; and also places with internet.

### Communication

We mostly communicate by Facebook messenger, but a thing of interest is a community's project: a *slack bot* or a *telegram bot* to improve our ommunication channels. We already have a Facebook group.

We think that our community could benefit from other ways of communication, such as a Slack channel (because of all of its useful integrations).

### Culture

As we've mentioned our community is very diverse, so we are very open to new people and ideas. We believe that multidisciplinary people and diversity creates the most amazing projects!

Whenever there's a disagreement, we make use of democracy and vot for what we think is the best option. A cool thing about our community culture is that we easy accept decisions that are taken this way.

Currently we do not have any documentation of our protocols, policies or procedures of our events. We only try to be loyal to our community culture (our open philosphy) and try to do our best. A thing of consideration for **community improvement** is the creation of all this documentation. Personally, as the community leader I'd assign people who can perfectly work on this and to evaluate and contribute for the development of this documentation.
