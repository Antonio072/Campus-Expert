## Summary of the Community's Needs

I'm a student in the Department of Mathematics, in the Natural and Exact Sciences Division of the Guanajuato (this is the main) Campus at the University of Guanajuato. The **University of Guanajuato (UG)** has 4 campuses in different cities along the state (our state has 46 cities, and UG has presence in all the state). Each campus contains different divisions and each division several careers. In total, **we are around 37,000 students from all campuses at all levels**.

An interesting thing is that even if you belong to a specific campus of the university, **by belonging to a student group (or community) you have presence in each division of your campus and even in other campuses**. *How?* By communicating through student groups that belong to other campuses. This creates opportunities to create events for each and every student (you can think about us as a very big team with different subteams that act autonomous but connected at the same time). There are a lot of groups with differen interests: sport groups, academic groups, social groups, tech groups, etc. **The university is very supportive with the activities of each group**, providing almost any material requested in order to realize an *event* from the group.

Right now, I'm co-founder and leader of a student group (called **futureÂ·lab**) that mainly focuses on creating events  in which:
* We develop awesome sci-tech based projects that help society. For this, we need to constantly update our knowledge and skills.
* We teach other students how to program not caring about what they're studying, we have created workshops for different academic areas in our university. **This is possible throught collaborations we already have with other student groups.**
* We give an approach to nowadays technology topics and projects for students through tech-talks, conferences, coaching, and mentoring.

The size of the local community is around 120 students.

The culture of collaboration and participation with student groups is present at UG, and each team member of every student group is open to new people and ideas.

Summarizing:
* **Community demographics:** UG has around 37k students, and our local community is around 120 students. This community is deiverse and mostly interested in science and technology.
* **Communication:** We mantain contact with every other student group at UG through email, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. The same communication channels are used for group members in the local community.
* **Culture:** The community is very participative and open to new people and ideas. The idea of helping other in different ways is very present for most of students.


## My Proposal

Along the Campus Experts program, a thing of interest is the aquisition and creation of shareable knowledge for the student community in general. Since it wouldn't be hard to create events at my university, the interesting thing would be to create great content/activities for these events. With this, a proposal is to create at least monthly events with tech-talks, create effective communication channels and (**this is important**) create a repository to have control and order of everything: the official activities calendar, all the material, reports of activities, etc.

Segmented strategy:
- ** Events**: 
	Create different kind of events: 
	- Tech talks from specialized people
	- Workshops from expert students
	- Open discussions (student-to-student)
	- Big open event for all student groups
	- Webinars
	- Hackathons and project nights
- **Timing**: Create an official calendar for every event. The activities will be planned on time adjusted so most students can assist. The idea is to create events not during exams. The beginning of each semester is the best time for everyone. Even on vacation if the material is already prepared, we can reach student communities with the webinars.
- **Community demographics**: A way to grow the community is to impact more people. With big open events, other students will get interested and the community will become more variated.
- **Communication**: Create media chats for direct communication, such as Fb messenger chats, and a Slack channel. Create an open repo with a calendar for every event or activity. Create an after-event session for Q&A's to let people interact, and create online webinars.
- **Goals**:
	1. Create a list of events and contact people for this events (who is going to talk or teach in workshops).
	2. Create a calendar or timeline for all the activities.
	3. Create a goals list for each event.
	4. Create an open repo with all the information for everyone.
	5. Create the communication channels (slack, etc.).
	6. Create reports for each session/activity/event, compare with the goals planned for that event.
	7. **Be open to sugestions of improvement, it might be possible that we are not seeing the full landscape, and the community has the best feedback for improvement.**


## My Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

By areas:
- Target audience
  - Our immediate target audience are the already tech-related students that belong to the community.
  - The rest of the target will be the we will be looking for in order to expand our community.
  - All students will be students interested in technology, not necessarily programmers, since we will create big open events for every student, with an "*easy-languaged*" (easy to understand) topic.
  - Communities from other student groups in my university (as an advantage of student groups collaborations).
- Community needs
  - Open events not only for tech-related students.
  - More speciallized events for tech-related students.
  - Tools, knowledge and activities that will improve students' professional preparation.
  - A more structured community for tech events and activities (communication is important here).
- Resources
  - Open repository with:
  	- Online material (such as lectures, workshops, etc.).
  	- An open calendar with all events.
  	- These will be easy to be created with GitHub Pages by our community.
  - Community database (for emails and any other analysis stuff). This will be important to get feedback. Also easy to be created by the community, even using a Google Form.
  - Auditorium and classrooms for events. These can be asked to the university by the community as a student group without any cost.
  - Budget to get speakers to talks or for having cookies/coffee during events. The university also provides budget for events for every student group.
  - Creation of material for the repo. This will be created by the person who gives the talk/workshop/etc.
- Media
  - Creating social media events and inviting people.
  - Printing posters in strategic places.
  - Sending *personalized* emails to all the community (using an email service).
  - By personally inviting people.
  - Through communication channels, since we will have an open calendar, it will be easy to let people know aabout most of our events at once.
- Content knowledge
  - The core team of our community is experimented on tech talks and conferences, workshops and event organization.
  - We have a diverse team with different areas of knowledge.
  - We like to create repos for every event, so people have access to all the material we use for each event.
  - We also have support from other student commnities at UG, so it wouldn't be difficult to get an expert of a specific area for an event.
- Timeline
  1. Define member roles for our impact project.
  2. Define events to be realized and set tentative dates.
	  - (Monthly) Tech talks/conferences (~1 hour)
	  - (Monthly) Project night (~3 hours)
	  - (Bimonthly) Workshops (~2 hours)
  3. Define events structure and duration.
  4. Create events calendar, and repository for material and feedback.
  5. Let the community know more about us. Tell people about our near future plans (all about our events).
  6. Realize events, and ask for feedback on each event.
  7. Create a record of every activity realized.

## Planning for the Future


- **We will review our impact proposal for every activity/event.** It is important to have in mind our goals and how we want to work in order to achieve them. So, we will need to see how the implementation of out impact proposal goes, because it might be able to improve some considerations according to new needs.
- **We will measure success** on the number of atendees to each event, and also with the evaluation and analysis of each feedback survey for every event. This will be important considerations for what we mention in the previous point.
- **We eill iterate on our community plans** each time needed. Since we will be considerating our goals all the time, with the measure of success from the previous point, we might need to adjust the activities, methods, events, protocols, spaces, etc. in order to improve our way to reach our goals.
