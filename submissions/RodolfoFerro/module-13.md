# Create an Atom plugin

*Wanna know basic Pok√©mon's info right in hand?*

I created an [Atom](https://atom.io/) package to provide Pok√©mon's info of a selected word (in case it is a Pok√©mon). You can find the repository to this plugin here: [https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pokeinfo](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pokeinfo)

## Usage üíª

By selecting a word, or just by having the cursor over a word; just press `Ctrl + Alt + p` to activate the PokeSearch of the package.

## How it works ‚öôÔ∏è

The package directly interacts with the [Pok√©api](https://pokeapi.co/), by consuming the API searching for info of the selected word. In case the word selected is a Pok√©mon, it will display that Pok√©mon's info. If it is not, it will just say it is not a Pok√©mon.

# Bonus activity

Since nobody had done this before, I published my first [Atom plugin](https://atom.io/packages), you can find it published in here: [https://atom.io/packages/pokeinfo](https://atom.io/packages/pokeinfo)
