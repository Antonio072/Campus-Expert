# Hubot script

I deployed on Heroku a Hubot called ***flabot***, with a Slack adapter. 

After this, I developed a script that comsumes the Pokéapi to return Pokémon info. This also can list a user's public repos and show the last xkcd comic. (And more...)

You can see my script running on *flabot* in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esixqadotyI):

- The repo with *flabot* is this one: [https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/flabot](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/flabot)
- The repo with only my script is here: [https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/hubot-rod_script](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/hubot-rod_script)
- And finally, I published my script in npm, as you can see here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-rod_script](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hubot-rod_script)
  (Please feel free to `npm install hubot-rod_script`!)
