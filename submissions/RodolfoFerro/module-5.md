# Sentiment analysis on Trump's tweets (workshop) using Python 🐍

> **DESCRIPTION:**
>In this workshop we will:
>1. Extract twitter data using tweepy and learn how to handle it using pandas.
>2. Do some basic statistics and visualizations with numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
>3. Do sentiment analysis of extracted (Trump's) tweets using textblob.

I hope you find this a bit useful and/or interesting. I taught this workshop in *Mexico City*. I'll explain the whole instructions along with code, in the most simple way possible. Anyway, all the code can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook I used for this workshop](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pandas_twitter/blob/master/Minado%20de%20datos%20en%20Twitter.ipynb).

It might be possible to find little mistakes in the translation of the material (I designed the workshop in Spanish, originally 😅). Please feel free to comment or suggest all that comes up to your mind. That would complement some ideas that I already have in mind for further work. 😀

## Contents

You will find a well structured markdown file containing the contents for each section, you can directly begin on the [prerequisite](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pandas_twitter/blob/master/00-prerequisite.md) section. At the end of each file you'll find the direct link to the next/previous section, so you do not need to keep going back to this README in order to got to the desired section.
