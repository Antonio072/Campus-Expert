# Write a README

Hello! 🤓🚀

I designed a workshop that I taught to a [very very awesome group of women](https://twitter.com/LaboratoriaMX) in Mexico City, on September 2nd. The thing is that I originally left all the repo's README blank. I wasn't very sure what to describe about that README. 

Recently I decided to write and describe all the workshop as simple as possible in my personal blog, without thinking that it might work well as a README file for specifically this repo of the workshop. But now that I've focused on the technical writing (thanks for this awesome module!), I wrote the README file according the considerations mentioned in the module, which I quote:

> Technical writing is a title that covers many things: it could be blogging, documentation or structured tutorials and workshops.

The link to the repo (where you will find the README) is here: [https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pandas_twitter](https://github.com/RodolfoFerro/pandas_twitter)

I've already asked for feedback in the following issue. 💬

**Opened issue:** [#470](https://github.com/campus-experts/open-training/issues/470)

### I'm very interested to improve my technical writing, so it'd be awesome if you can give me any feedback, please! 🙌🏼 

Thank you very much! :smiley:
