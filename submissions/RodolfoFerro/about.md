# Welcome to my introduction! üöÄ

My name is Rodolfo Ferro, but you may call me **Rod**. I'm an undergrad student in mathematics at the [University of Guanajuato](http://www.ugto.mx/) in Guanajuato, Mexico. I do maths, but I also enjoy doing computer science stuff. üòé This is why I'm actually working on my thesis about machine learning + computer vision + thermal images processing. I consider myself a sci-tech enthusiast and I like to *"Code it once, run it forever"*. In **#Python** it is. üêç

Now, I'll try to tell you about what I like to do and a bit of what I've done so far. :)


## Education

Besides and along the university, I've participated in several academic activities, such as:
* [Summer internship](http://www.ugto.mx/noticias/noticiasrssen/12090-student-of-the-university-of-guanajuato-makes-research-in-harvard-university) at Harvard University.
* [Winter internship](http://www.ugto.mx/noticias/noticias/10873-estudiante-ug-desarrolla-proyecto-matematico-para-prevenir-enfermedades-cronico-degenerativas) at CIMAT (Mathematics Research Center in Zacatecas).
* Attended summer and winter schools about: image processing and statistical recognition of patterns, modelling and numerical methods, evolutive computing.


## Professional experience

I've served as a Google Student Ambassador LatAm back on 2014-2015, and learned a lot about creating a Campus Community. Since then, I've enjoyed enrolling in diferent activities that involve science, technology, and creating community. Right now I'm running my own podcast [def Podcast(mx):](https://defpodcastmx.github.io/) exclusively about Python, in Spanish.

Besides this, I'm a team member of [Clubes de Ciencia M√©xico](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/), an organization that teaches interestic science topics for pre-college and college students, where I've been a student, a developer, and also an instructor (even having the oportunity lo teach a [science workshop](https://rodolfoferro.github.io/ExplorandoLosSentidos/) designed by the 2004 Nobel Prize, Frank Wilczek!).


## Hobbies

I really like to spend time on the internet not only watching memes üòÖ, but trying to be productive being a self learner. (The internet is the best source of information, I mean, right now we're on a training GitHub course...)

I like going to hackathons, I've won only two and have been a mentor in one. I love creating tech solutions for society and using programming even to **just have fun** ü§ìüíª by: 
* [creating simulations of electrons](https://rodolfoferro.wordpress.com/2015/06/07/inestabilidad-de-electrones-en-dos-haces/), 
* [creating bots that tweet fractals](https://rodolfoferro.wordpress.com/2017/04/13/juliasetbot-ü§ñ), 
* [analyzing sentiments in Trump's tweets](https://dev.to/rodolfoferro/sentiment-analysis-on-trumpss-tweets-using-python-), or simply 
* [play around with computer vision stuff](https://rodolfoferro.wordpress.com/2017/09/15/testing-facial-landmarks-detection-with-python/).
