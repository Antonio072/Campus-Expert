# About Me

### Intro

Hi! I'm Youssef Moawad (aka Devdude). I study Computer Science and Physics at the University of Glasgow, just starting my third year now. 

### My community

I'm currently a member of the committee of the Glasgow University Tech Society (GUTS). This year, I'm hoping to get involved in organising our hackathon (Do You Have The GUTS) in October and help create a better experience for everyone. I will also be trying to start running a series (or maybe a few) mini-workshops (or maybe not so mini 😉) to get non-CS students interested in the tech scene. So I believe I will definitely be taking on the Workshops Module.

### Favourite Emoji (and more about me)

I used to think the 😂laughing crying face😂 was my favourite emojis but more recently I've been quite a fan of 👌🏾. It just feels so 👌🏾👌🏾.

In my free time, I usually do iOS App/Game Development, and I've published a bunch of wee apps and arcade-style games to the App Store. If you're interested, you can read about them here: [devdude.me/projects](http://devdude.me/projects).

I also enjoy learning and blogging about Particle Physics and Quantum Mechanics. If you're interested in physics at all, I run my blog here: [devdude.me/blog](http://devdude.me/blog) and I've mostly been blogging about physics (but haven't updated it in months, oops!).

Happy Hacking!

👌🏾👌🏾
