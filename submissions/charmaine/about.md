# About Me
Hey! :wave: I'm Charmaine. I just finished my second year in the CS program at the University of British Columbia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦! I'm headed to SAP next for an 8 month Co-op as a Full Stack Developer. I love building anything from PWAs to VR/AR! I am a huge sucker for sitcoms and have watched The Office 7 ~~too many~~ times. When I have my headphones, I'm probably listening to musicals. When I don't have my headphones, I'm probably thinking about musicals. :blush:

## Community Involvement
On campus, you can generally catch me running around campus TA-ing my favourite Computer Science courses, and planning fun and inclusive events for our Computer Science Student Society! I also spend a lot of my free time attending local meetups, and more recently, started speaking at them! Lastly, I love travelling all around North America to different hackathons-- I loved them so much that I ended up cofounding and organizing UBC Hacks last year!
