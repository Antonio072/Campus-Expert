# About Paul
Hello friends! I'm Paul and I'm currently a CE student at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Canada!🍁🍁🍁

I founded and am currently leading the first ever uOttaHack hackathon organizing team, super excited to join the amazing community of student hackathon organizers! In addition to uOttaHack, I'm also the Director of Sponsorship for CUSEC 2018 (Canadian University Software Engineering Conference) and V.P. Internal for our Engineering Student Society.

(And a big Sens / Jays/ Raptors fan)
