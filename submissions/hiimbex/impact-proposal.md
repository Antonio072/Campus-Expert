## Summary of the Community's Needs

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: ~30 students from underrepresented backgrounds studying CS at AU.
- **Communication**: Mostly a Facebook group.
- **Culture**: Pretty chill, lots of mutual complaining about how our school should support us better.

Basically, we need a relaxed mutual space to help learn from each other and spend time with like minded people to help advance our futures in the tech world.

## Your Proposal

I'd like us to improve our communication skills and get more community involvement. Often our meetings feel poorly planned out or are not as well done because the exec board members don''t have the time necessary to commit to such a work load around a club. The options are either to find more interested members in helping organize or somehow reinforce the importance of the club to the leadership team.

## Your Proposal's Impact

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal? Students studying CS at AU from underrepresented backgrounds
- Community needs
  - What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal? Our need to have people like us in our environment to support each other in a white cis male dominated tech world.
- Resources
  - What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal? The biggest resource needed is people and time and effort from members of the community.
  - How will you obtain those resources? Hopefully we can create enugh interest in reinvigorating the club by reinforcing its goals and the importance of our mutual bonding.   
- Media
  - How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project? Probably changing the way we organize our Facebook group or switching to a new form of communication, but I worry people won't be as willing to change.
  - What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content? Get it reviewed by the community through surveys.
- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on? Pretty knowledgable, I have a tech internship and am an active open source contributor.
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge? The internet! The open source community!
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project. I'd love to work on this during my free time next semester when I'm abroad, but I don't want to commit myself when I'm not sure yet what my course load will be.
  - If you are presenting content, identify the timing of your presentation. N/A

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal? I think it will go into effect when I go back to AU next spring, and I can evaluate at the end of the semester.
- How will you measure success? Community involvement. There are ~30 members of my community but only 5-10 regularly show up to meetings and participate in our events.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans? Probably per semester, since we vote on a new exec board for every semester.
