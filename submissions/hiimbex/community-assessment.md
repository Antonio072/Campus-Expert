### Definition
- How would you define your community?
Underrepresented groups trying to get started in tech, specifically at my school.
### Size
- How many people are currently in your community? AU ACM is around ~50 active members including alum, with maybe half being from underrepresented groups
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community? Indifferent? The current size is nice without being too large, but growing could also be nice too, especially relative to the rest of the ACM community
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change? Yes, computer science has always been a very small major at AU. ACM is the only club for the major, so there aren't currently any other groups on campus.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech? We maintain a resources page for ACM and a facebook page to share links, especially in the DC area.
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons? Yes, we frequently post about what's happening around DC and host some meetups and talks with potential employers.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community? They are all posted publicly or given out at our events, so relatively accessible.
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working? Since most involved are students, there are classes at all hours, but we usually meet in the evenings and mix it up from time to time to accommodate everyone.
- Is there childcare available? I do not believe so, but am unsure the capabilities of my campus since that is where the meetings are.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that? Mostly, or at least computer science minors. I think so because most majors at my school are very political, so it's nice to have a space where the goal isn't to talk about politics or do political activities.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific? I think our interests are pretty specific, but we do get lots of talks from alums in various CS careers, ie software engineering, IT, systems engineering, etc. I think we are open to any topics and usually we have fewer talks than time, so we're always looking for new content.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community? They want to learn CS or get a tech career and meet like-minded people on campus.
- Are they students hoping to get a degree? Yes, usually.
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job? Yes, eventually.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major? Not necessarily. I think a lot of students at my school see CS as a means to a good career, which is completely valid. I personally am passionate about developing, but a lot of people use our club for career development and job advice.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals? Maybe more CS class office hours, and chill coding sessions. A goal is basically to do well in school and have friends in your classes.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather? On campus, it's a small campus so everyone is close together.
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet? We usually meet in person on campus.
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free? I wish parking on campus was free ðŸ˜­
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups? There is an AU shuttle, but everyone's a student so they have to come to campus some way.
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus? It's on campus for that reason.
- How much does it cost to use the space? Nothing for us, I don't know about the school.
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings? We can book different rooms based on our needs.
- How many people can it fit? The largest room on campus is maybe 100 people? But we usually have less than 20 attendees.
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes? It depends on the room, but because of the school's booking system we don't get a lot of choice.
- Is there water or snacks available nearby? We provide free food and drink at every event!

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another? We send out weekly emails to our mailing list and have a Facebook group.
- Is there an email group, a Gatha organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel? Email mailing list and Facebook.
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating? I think what we have is enough, if not too much. We make a Facebook event for every event we host and I think some people think it's too much notification spam. I'm not sure the best way to communicate with our members though.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas? Very welcoming! We host an event at the beginning of this school to get to know each other and encourage new invitees. We frequently send out community surveys to gather feedback. But it's hard to make such a small community seem less intimidating because you can't really blend in, or just watch, and I think that intimidates some people.
- What happens if there is a disagreement? I don't think this has ever happened, but in a worst case scenario we have campus safety on speed dial.
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented? No, but in an ideal community, we would certainly.
- How will you personally handle it? I will try to get people to act reasonably, but if anyone's safety is in danger, I will call campus safety.
