Hi! I'm Bex (aka hiimbex). I'm studying Computer Science and Studio Art at American University in DC, but I'm from Chicago. I'm also spending this summer interning at Github!

I am involved with my school's ACM and am on the leadership board for the club.

I love open source! Lately you can find me hacking on [probot](https://github.com/probot) and [behaviorbot](https://github.com/behaviorbot) trying to help build, grow and maintain safe open source communities. You can check out some of my art [here](http://hiimbex.me)!

My favorite emoji is :fidget_spinner: but it's an internal slack exclusive. My favorite one I can include here is ðŸ‘¾
