what do you study, what community are you involved with, what's your favourite emoji? 
Hi! I'm Bex (aka hiimbex). I'm studying Computer Science and Studio Art at American University in DC, but I'm from Chicago. I'm also spending this summer interning at Github!

I am involved with my school's ACM and am on the leadership board for the club.

My favorite emoji is :fidget_spinner: but it's an internal slack exclusive. My favorite one I can include here is ðŸ‘¾
