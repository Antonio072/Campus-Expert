# About Corey

Hi, I'm Corey! I'm a student at UC Davis and the tech director of our computer science club.
I absolutely love hackathons and before UC Davis, helped run several high school hackathons in California (HS Hacks 1/2 and a local hack day).

## Interests

Beside coding, I love biking, hobbyist electronics, reading, rock climbing, video games, and learning random facts (did you know that water bears are practically immortal?).
And as for tech, I particularly love algorithms and compete in the ACM ICPC each year.

## Contacting Me

You can reach me at [coreysmason.com](http://coreysmason.com) (undergoing redesign) or via Facebook.
