# Workshop Outline 

The workshop that I've chosen to outline is an Introduction to Web Development (ie: HTML, CSS, Javascript). This is something that I have been wanting to learn for a while, and I've slowly been getting into it. I think that it's an important and an interactive way to start learning code, as it's not like Java, where you have to set up extremely verbose classes/methods/etc in order to start. 

## Learning Goals 

 + Recognizing the difference between HTML and CSS, and understanding how to use it to style text, making stylistic websites easier 
 + Understanding how CSS helps make styling easier compared to using bare HTML 
 + Understanding the role of Javascript and how the DOM plays a role in making interactive websites 

## Demonstrations and Examples 

 + Live web development in front of the tutorial section, so that participants can see dynamic changes in the web application 
 + Start with HTML and CSS
     * Start with styling just in HTML, showing participants how to emphasize/italicize or style text in just the browser 
         - Then, go into trying to style multiple things with the same style 
         - Which leads into CSS, and what the use of it is 
 + Then start moving into Javscript and explaining/introducing the DOM model and how to access sections of a website 
 + Then, ask them to pair up with one other person to create a website of their choice (details follow in the next section) 

## Discussions and Pairing Opportunities 

 + Pair programming in which two people work together to create a website of their choice, and then two groups come together and provide criticism/feedback on each other's websites
     * Ensure to tell partcipants to provide constructive feedback, and not personal critism 
 + Then, all groups come together, and demo others' websites and talk about the feedback that was received/given 
     * I also think it's important to provide feedback to the participants. I believe this is best done as a feedback given back to a group. Then, in order to better circulate past feedbacks and/or feedback, we can keep updating a `Feedback` file. 
     * I think constructive criticism by us, the presentors, will be difficult in a large group. It may make people uncomfortable, and may deter people from coming to our workshops. For that reason, I think it's better to note down feedback for the websites, and then let them know afterward, preferably in person, so they can clarify/understand improvements. 
     * Then, all of this feedback can be compiled into general tips that were mentioned in the previous point. 
 + I would like to have mentors on hand to be able to answer questions participants might have as well. This allows participants access to adequate help, ensuring that they do not feel discouraged or lost. 

## Recovery Points 

 + Breaks are very important in this situation, as learning a new language is difficult, and trying to cram it into a few hours at a time, wihtout breaks is difficult. I was a TA for a course over the summer, which had 3 hour night classes for Introductory Computer Science, and it was nearly impossible to sit still for so long. I think a 5-10 minute break every hour is relatively reasonable, and allows pariticpants who are behind to catch up, if they have any questions. 
 + I also like the idea of having a GitHub repo that keeps track of all the steps that we are going to reach, so someone doesn't have to be caught up in order to continue. 
     * On that note, this is also where Code Starter Packs come in handy. I first heard about them at HackMIT, however have not had much time to look into it. Especially for beginners, these packs are able to provide them with a starter point. 

## Participatory Learning 

 + As I would like this to be a live demonstration of code, I think it's very easy to involve participants in deciding the style/what the website should contain. It could be a simple personal website, for instance, and we can be dynamic in what we plan to add. We can ask participants for ideas on content, and how to style them. 
     * Traditionally, the ideas on content/participation in class is often done, in a classroom setting, where people shout out their answers/raise their hands, etc. While I believe that this way is effective, I have also been a lot of these workshops in which some people are outspoken and/or this method favours the extraverted participants. 
     * I would like to take this somewhat traditional idea, and combine it with an online/anonymous interactive submission of some sort, where people can comfortably suggest what they want to add/see during the live demo, without having to raise their hand.
     * For instance, if the presentor asked for suggestions to style a website, they would be open to people shouting out ideas/raising their hand with ideas, but on a separate screen, be able to see the live feedback coming in, which would be other opinions. 

## Adapting to Participants 

 + I'd like to ask them questions to guage their skill level and potential experience, so that I can prepare what is required for the workshop. For instance, if the attendence is 50/50 - beginners/advanced level, then I might consider running two separate sessions. If it is heavily towards one side, then I can account for exercises for the more advanced topics, but also have a few exercises/tasks for the advanced-level people to have something that can push them out of their boundaries. 
 + For Web development, another benefit is that they don't need an external IDE of any sort - as long as they have a browser, it will have a JavaScript Console window. 
 + If a section of the content is too advanced, I think I can give them extra/additional tasks that would be a brain teaser or equally challenging for them to implement. I wouldn't want to give them something entirely out of their scope, but enough to push them slightly outside of their comfort zone to learn something. 
 + Otherwise, if a section of the content is too advanced, it depends on the percentage of the group. 
     * If most are having trouble understand an aspect of the content, then I think it is important to go over it again. If majority of people don't understand it, I think it may be that it was not presented clearly/concisely enough to the participants, and therefore they do not understand it. 
     * Otherwise, if it's a few people running behind, I think the GitHub repository of branches of steps is very useful, because it ensures that participants can follow along, even if they had not completed the first step. Given this flexibility in steps, participants can ask further questions or we can provide explanations of concepts that are still being misunderstood/people having trouble understanding 

## What happens after? 

 + As I'd like to implement mentors in PhaseOne, I think mentors can play a really big role in enabling participants to keep learning. A lot of the time, the reason that we give up is because something is too difficult to understand, so people get discouraged and rather give up. I think having mentors to be there if participants are having troubles is very important, just as it is at a hackathon. Mentor presence in the community is even moreso important, for the longevity of reducing barriers to learning code. 
 + Further exercises could be placed on the GitHub repository, on another branch, with the stepped modules. We can not only provide extra exercises, but also solutions to those exercises in the branches. 
     * On that note, GitHub Issues is another place that participants can ask for help, similar to the one that Campus experts uses. I think it's a really efficient way to keep track of questions, as you can open/close/comment on them, and allows other users to browse through past questions as well.
