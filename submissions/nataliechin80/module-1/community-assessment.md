# Defining my Community 

## Current Community 
I define my community as students interested in technology at McMaster University. This is our ideal community. The community, PhaseOne was developed to lower the boundaries of getting into and exploring different technologies, and ensure that we were providing support structures in order to better allow members access to the newest technologies. That being said, there are ways in which I think PhaseOne could be improved. 

# Size 

At current, we reach around 500 students. I would like to expand this community to at least 800. I would also like to enhance the community that we have in place. The community at the moment, is very scattered, and there is not a lot of hype around PhaseOne activities, so I would like to better the participant experience, and try to get them more involved in our events. 

The group has always been around the same size. 

# Resources 

We have weekly CodeNights, each night with a different focus. This allows many students to dip their feet into new technologies that they may not otherwise have access to such as Arduinos, 3D printing tutorials, IOT ideas, Web Development Tutorials, and many others. 

Under PhaseOne, we run DeltaHacks, an annual hackathon at McMaster University for social change. DeltaHacks was formed when members of our community realized that there were not many social impact related hackathons in Canada, so we started our own. This focus proved very useful throughout the years, as a lot of our winning projects involved health care industry applications such as helping doctors with diagnostics, and helping patients better their hospital experience.

There are also online tools available on the PhaseOne website. It provides list of resources for people to self-learn programming languages. I have personally had experience with a lot of these websites, and proved to be extremely useful throughout the years. 

# Interests 

At current, our community is a mix of different faculties, most especially Computer Science and Software Engineering. In addition to enhancing this community, and bringing in new members, I would also like to reach out to a variety of people in different backgrounds. Personally, I went into university in Commerce, then switched into Computer Science. I strongly feel that we are not limited by our subject major in order to learn how to code/learn about code. As I work with DeltaHacks, I am Head of Supportive Relations which involves recruiting mentors and judges, screening attendee applications and ensuring attendees are enjoying the event. I want to emphasize that we are beginner friendly, and open to people in all faculties. Though this goal, at current, is specifically for the hackathon, I want to make sure that our PhaseOne community also mirrors this vision. 

The community is very open to a diverse set of topics. The code nights last year consisted of workshops from Arduinos to Microsoft Azure to Algorithm based questions. This year, we are exploring different areas like 3D printing, and such tutorials. 

# Goals 

People get involved, because PhaseOne is a thriving technological company, which I believe people are drawn to. I like being in a room with a diverse set of people from different majors, and being able to hear stories of how projects are developed, how people gained inspiration. People come out to our CodeNights because they feel a welcome environment to learn something new. People use our Facebook group as a way to ask questions on topics they are confused about, and as a way to ask for resources of things they want to learn. Administrators and moderators do a fantastic job of ensuring all posts adhere to our culture, and are quick to act if something is abnormal. 

Members of our community often turn to the Facebook Pages to ask for resources and helpful tutorials, to share their projects, to talk about their experiences (at companies, with technologies), and to share general knowledge. 

# Location 

CodeNights occur weekly, on campus, usually in the evenings. Attendance has been low at CodeNights - I believe, because not many people know that it is happening. I would like to find a way to expand and to inform people know about the fantastic opportunities. In terms of accessibility, there is parking on campus, but it is not free. There are some side streets that offer free parking, but are around a 5-10 minute walk from campus. I believe the location is accessible to those off campus, as they are very close to bus routes, and around 15-20 minutes from the downtown Hamilton core. There is also a main bus hub right on campus. We do not have to pay for these rooms - we do have to book the rooms in advance. 

The choice of room depends on whether we want it to be for collaborative learning, meetings, or presentations. We have a variety of rooms on campus that are open for this choice. As with the number of people we can fit, we can alter the room we book depending on how many people we expect. Rooms on campus can hold anywhere between 20 people to 1000 people! I do believe that we offer comfortable seating for all; all buildings have elevators to allow accessible accommodations. Every building on campus has filtered water fountains. There is also cafeteria service or a coffee shop in most buildings on campus, which allow easy access to grab succulence. In addition, there are multitude of restaurants and fast food stops on campus borders. 

Otherwise, many members of our community are online on the Facebook page. There is always activity bustling there, and always people pitching ideas, looking for new team members, and looking for assistance. 

# Communication 

Communication happens mainly through Facebook Groups. The administrative memebers of PhaseOne, otherwise communicate through a Slack Channel. 

I believe that other methods of communication would definitely benefit PhaseOne. I think an email group would be really effective in letting people know about upcoming events. I think Slack Channels for the entirety of PhaseOne would also be efficient, because we can efficiently ask questions and group it according to question topic. On Facebook, it is a good way to reach out ot a large group of people, but is otherwise difficult to backtrack messages and keep related messages grouped together. On the downside, Slack has a message of 10K, so it is definitely something I have to keep in mind for future. 

# Culture 

One thing I am most proud of is the culture at PhaseOne. We are extremely open to newcomers - and they feel welcome at CodeNight events. At my first CodeNight event, I was faced with an Arduino, and I had no idea what to do, how to use it, so I teamed up with another person who also had no idea how to use it, and we had fun exploring how to play music using the Arduino Speaker. This experience was liberating for me, because I had never seen an Arduino before, and within 1-2 hours, I was able to make it play a song. I want to improve the culture though - I want us to not only be beginner friendly, but I want us to be a unifying force. I want members of the community to be proud of being a part of PhaseOne, and I want to keep people coming back and wanting more.  

I have been a part of the community for 2 years now, and I have seen a few disagreements. They are always handled professionally, and involve each side expressing their idea of the story, leading to compromise of some sort. In DeltaHacks, we have General Expectations set into stone, which cover expectations of treating fellow team members, and who to contact if a disagreement does take place. 

Personally, I would like to hear both sides of the full story. I would like to understand and to know how the disagreement came up, and the background of where it stemmed from. I think it is important to get the full context of the disagreement, in depth, and to understand each party. Then, we can start talking about compromises and changes we can make to make each party happy. In future, I would like to extend the policies and procedures in place for PhaseOne, as well.
