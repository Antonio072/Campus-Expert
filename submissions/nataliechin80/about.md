# Hello! 

I'm Natalie. I'm studying Computer Science at McMaster University, in Ontario, Canada. 

I am actively involved in organizing Deltahacks, an annual hackathon with a theme of social change. I'm in Head of Supportive Relations, which involves reaching out to mentors and judges that would be suitable for our event. 

Outside of DeltaHacks, I'm often at one code night or another learning a new technology, or self learning a new technology. I'm genuinely curious for the newest tech trends and how to use it, and love trial and error.

Sometimes, when I attempt to read code for too long, it feels like I've been hanging upside down on the monkey bars: ðŸ™ƒ
