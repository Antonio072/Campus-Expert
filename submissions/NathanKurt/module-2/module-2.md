### Moderation Case Study


### Nature of the incident

In the Facebook Group It's Intern Season, A post was made saying 

```"i kinda feel like we shouldn't shitpost about student ran projects (ex: hackathons). it's funny when the devs are anonymous and it's a big company's bug that we're making fun of but it would suck ass if you're a student and you see your hard work being put as a meme"``` 

The post mostly had people in agreement, saying, "The big companies give us more than enough stuff to make fun of, let's make fun of them" But then there were a few people saying things like "We need more tech hazing, and we should always mock people which was a pretty controversial opinion that could stir up future debate and cause more maliciousness in the community. 

### Moderation action

The mods first went ahead and banned the person quickly, deleting all of their posts and then posting something that said: 

  ```"[admin post] I banned Alfredo for believing in a hazing process in tech. I also deleted comments of his that suggested that tech should be unwelcoming. (Understatement) At least for me- I am unwelcoming to folks that are unwelcoming. " ```
  
  They kept one of his posts up but removed the rest trying to make an example of him while also showing what they did wrong. and also explained why that isn't cool and the type of culture he wants to have in the community. 
  
  

### Outcome

A few other people after that complained and there was an initial outburst by some people in agreement with him, but after they encouraged the same types of things but this time adding some homophobic slurs in there, they were also struck by the banhammer pretty rapidly. The response overall seemed pretty positive and worked well for the community as a whole. 


### What could be different?

It seemed like they did a pretty good job of following the "conversational akido" tactics mentioned with the trolls where you have cut them off swiftly and show that there are consequences to get others to stop. What they did seemed to work pretty well and fit that situation, however the extinction tactic could have worked pretty well too I think. They could have issued an official warning and called them out on it. They may have stopped after that, but I think they would have continued to be pretty toxic to the community so banning them right away seems like the best call if you don't want to take any more chances. I think for the situation though, the mods chose the best course of action.
