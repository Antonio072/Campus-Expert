## Assessing Your Community's Needs

### Definition
Students at Michigan State University and Lansing area interested in growing and becoming part of the tech community

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
  - There are currently about 1100 computer science students at Michigan State. Last year about 700 people that applied for       SpartaHack were from MSU. 
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
  - Ideally, I would like to see the size of the community be about 1600, enough for all of the passionate computer science,       computer engineering, and any other person in a major who is passionate about making cool stuff with code. As long as we       have key contributors in the community to keep it alive though, we should be fine.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
  - The group has definitely been growing, We have gotten a lot more people coming into the computer science major lately and     it's awesome. Coding is starting to become cool because of all the opportunities it provides. And it may only continue to     grow and we will have to scale with it 

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  - We have a bunch of clubs: Spartan Hackers for bi-weekly meetings/workshops, ACM for other people passionate about tech.    Women in computing is available for women. We also have SpartaHack, Michigan State's hackathon to to go to as well as a bunch of other hackathons near places like Oakland, UMich and UofI for people to sharpen their skills even more. 

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
  - Meetings are normally held later at night when people should be done with classes and should be out of work. We make sure to try to provide for food on most days as an incentive also even if people are pretty tired. 
- Is there childcare available?
  - I don't think Childcare is really an issue since just about everybody is in college and we aren't really marketing it to non-college students. 

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
 - We have a mix of Computer science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering students. Anybody is welcome to come though. Our past SpartaHack Executive Director was a Statistics Major so 
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  - We are pretty open to talk about a lot of topics. Intro topics might be the most helpful since the community is growing pretty steadily. People can volunteer to give talks about a bunch of things though to attract a bunch of diverse audiences

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
 - Most people realize that classes won't teach you everything you need to have the suitable skills to get a job in the CS department so they want to branch out and learn more skills. Other people are super passionate about development and want to learn as much as they can for funsies. Eventually the people that just came to learn also start getting pretty passionate about development and excited about it and start looking to help out or be a more active part of the community.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
 - We try to host talks and meetups that can be homework meetups and others that are stuff that stray away from class subjects so people can learn that extra skills that aren't necessarily taught in the classroom. 

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
 - We gather at a few places near the engineering building on campus. We also have a few Facebook groups for different clubs in the community. There is parking near there, but it costs a few dollars. We have shuttles that can take you there though and a good chunk of people live on campus anyways so they can walk there without much extra effort. At one of our buildings we can fit about 600 people. But for most meetups that aren't hackathons we have about 60ish people come to each one which is a pretty good number that still allows for questions instead of more of a lecture style type thing.


### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
 - We have a few Facebook groups for things, and SpartaHack has a twitter account also. but we could make a Slack channel to drive communication more easily.  

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
 - Our community is pretty open to new people and ideas and getting involved is super easy and not too cliquey.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
 - We have a slack channel for all of the E-board members of all the different CS clubs and we talk everything out there to figure something out. In the end, there is a vote that takes place most of the time. 
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
  - We have a sidebar with rules for our FB group, but we are pretty loose with the rules. When the need comes to implement something, we will do that then.
- How will you personally handle it?
  - I will talk to some people in the CS Leader Slack, see what the issue is. Then I willl deal with the issue by talking to the person where hopefully everybody is happy.
