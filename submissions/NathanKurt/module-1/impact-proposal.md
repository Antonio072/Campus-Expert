## Summary of the Community's Needs


**Community demographics**
Right now, we have a large amount of people who are new to coding and aren't really sure where to go. Bringing them in and marketing to our new potential audience is super important. We also have some people who have only done CS stuff for classes and don't know how to progress from there. And then we also have some of the more advanced people. I will start by focusing on the beginners and then when we have something set up smoothly, from there I will focus more on the middle ground where those beginners have hopefully moved to and the other intermediates in limbo.

**Communication**:
We already have a Facebook group where people will communicate and the goal is both strengthening that and branching out to Slack also. We also have in person meet ups for clubs like Spartan Hackers and the Data Science club where people can come to learn things as well.

**Culture**:
Right now we have a culture that is pretty open and we do a good job of encouraging everybody to come and try to learn with us. We have a code of conduct lying around somewhere but it isn't really enforced or used much as not many problems have come up. We more try to deal with things on a case by case basis. This might need to be changed if more problems arise, but right now I think having it be pretty loose creates a lower barrier for entry.


## Your Proposal

I want to find a way to create the lowest possible barrier for entry possible for getting people involved in the community and finding things to do. For such a large potential community, we only have a few regulars. I want to do this by recruiting the new beginners first to get them pumped so they can continue a cycle. Then we have to educate people on Slack and actually getting them to use it.

**Timing**:
I think the best time to start doing this is as soon as we get back to school when we have a huge influx of newbies coming that are looking to get involved. I think the best time to do it would be after the first week but before the 4th when people start getting busier.

**Community demographics**:
We already have the community here with a slack for the organizer of each CS club in a group, but by creating something like slack with all of the clubs and members in it, people can branch out from just one club and find other potential events to make the community more engaged and well-rounded.


**Goals**:
I want to make our community go from a cluster of different clubs to more of a lake style where things merge together and people can easily find other areas without much searching and find events relatively easy. We want to create an area where people can learn, socialize and develop skills together.

**Communication**:
Right now we have a facebook group that doesn't post all that much and if it does it's more for announcements than anything so it lacks any feeling of involvement or engagement in the community, by adding a slack for everybody to participate in, it gives everyone a chance to have a voice and find things that interest them easily.


## Your Proposal's Impact

-**Target audience**
  - As above, I plan to impact everybody, but the most work needs to be done with beginners to educate them about the groups and that there are opportunities to be available.
-**Community needs**
  - Our community is not as unified as it could be which makes it hard for people to find and participate in things that are still in the CS community
-**Resources**
  - Swag is the best way to bring people in and getting them to listen to something. If we can give them swag, we can educate them on slack and how to use it.
  - SpartaHack has some leftover swag that we can give away as soon as they show that they have the app and are joining the community. Maybe some flyers to post around to educate
-**Media**
  - The CS Club organizers have a slack channel where we can all communicate on and touch base with things. We can all make Facebook posts about it and all the clubs can talk about it and cross-polinate
-**Content knowledge**
  - I have a pretty extensive knowledge of Slack and marketing things to people since I did a lot of marketing stuff to the logistics side of things.
  - There are forums galore of Slack best practices that I will probably use and other people who run hackathons use slack a ton and also have good ideas about best ways to use it.
-**Timeline**
  - This will take place over the semester and refined throughout the time. Welcome week we will push Slack as a way to use things. Every time a club does something, Announce it and tell people to join it.
  - It will be a quick talk, "Hey use Slack, Download it to connect with a bunch of CS communities, then there will be a pinned post with a tutorial video to learn how to use it"


## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

**When will you review the impact of your proposal?**
  - At the end of the semester we will go and look at how many people are using it and what we can improve.
**How will you measure success?**
  - We will look at the size of the community and amount of active users which is sent to admins monthly via slack. We can use some of the data to dive in and find better ways to market it
**How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?**
  - Once a semester we will go back and look at them. But towards the end of the summer, we will get something together to make sure the community is still using it and how to market it to the new CS people coming in.
