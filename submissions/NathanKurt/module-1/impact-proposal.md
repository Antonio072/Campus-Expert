Now that you've [thought about your community's needs](community-assessment.md), it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make a :sparkles: impact on your community.

## Summary of the Community's Needs

Provide a summary of what you learned from your community assessment, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of other Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders).

The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
**Community demographics**
- Right now, we have a large amount of people who are new to coding and aren't really sure where to go. Bringing them in and marketing to our new potential audience is super important. We also have some people who have only done CS stuff for classes and don't know how to progress from there. And then we also have some of the more advanced people. I will start by focusing on the beginners and then when we have something set up smoothly, from there I will focus more on the middle ground where those beginners have hopefully moved to and the other intermediates in limbo.

- **Communication**: We already have a Facebook group where people will communicate and the goal is both strengthening that and branching out to Slack also. We also have in person meet ups for clubs like Spartan Hackers and the Data Science club where people can come to learn things as well.
-
- **Culture**: Right now we have a culture that is pretty open and we do a good job of encouraging everybody to come and try to learn with us. We have a code of conduct lying around somewhere but it isn't really enforced or used much as not many problems have come up. We more try to deal with things on a case by case basis. This might need to be changed if more problems arise, but right now I think having it be pretty loose creates a lower barrier for entry.


## Your Proposal

I want to find a way to get the community for involved in things. For such a large potential community, we only have a few regulars. I want to do this by recruiting the new beginners first to get them pumped so they can continue a cycle.

- **Timing**: I think the best time to start doing this is as soon as we get back to school when we have a huge influx of newbies coming that are looking to get involved. I think the best time to do it would be after the first week but before the 4th when people start getting busier.

- **Community demographics**: We already have the community here with a slack for the organizer of each CS club in a group, but by creating something like slack with all of the clubs and members in it, people can branch out from just one club and find other potential events to make the community more engaged and well-rounded.


- **Goals**: I want to make our community go from a cluster of different clubs to more of a lake style where things merge together and people can easily find other areas without much searching and find events relatively easy. We want to create an area where people can learn, socialize and develop skills together.

- **Communication**: Right now we have a facebook group that doesn't post all that much and if it does it's more for announcements than anything so it lacks any feeling of involvement or engagement in the community, by adding a slack for everybody to participate in, it gives everyone a chance to have a voice and find things that interest them easily.


## Your Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish.
Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal?
- Community needs
  - What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
- Resources
  - What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
  - How will you obtain those resources?
- Media
  - How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
  - What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
  - If you are presenting content, identify the timing of your presentation.

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
- How will you measure success?
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
