* Fundraising Module
  * We are raising money for our hackathon going on. 
  



* [Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16D5PwvQK4tZ1ZdIBw3EEY3ac7K2eS4ziJ2lkA2CMGdQ/edit?usp=sharing)
  * Spreadsheet wizardy over here. As we get sponsors, we add them to the sheet with details about what's going on.

* [Tiers](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3ckGYatlGOeNmZrSHh0ODFiTWc)
  * For tiers, we send out one to MSU companies like this, and one to other companies. This makes both people feel pretty good. Also since MSU companies can't necesarily afford to pay a ton but still want to be apart of the event, we give them a bit of a discount. 
* [Prospectus](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3ckGYatlGOeVTg0QW1EVnFrekU)
  * We have stats readily available for possible sponsors on the second page, but the first page has all of the information in terms of event info right on it. And then we send them the tiers seperately so they have quick access and don't have to scroll through the other info after they have already seen it once.
