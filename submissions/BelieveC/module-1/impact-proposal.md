# Community Impact Proposal for Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad

## Summary of the Community's Needs

After having a discussion with my colleagues at Tech-Society and Vishnu KS(Ex Campus-Expert), I believe following things need to be taken into consideration for next 1 year:

1. **Hobby groups** to promote different technologies and cohesive work culture.
2. Increase in **women participation** in events and workshops.
3. **Open source** development culture among freshmen and sophomore.
4. Help build real life **community projects**.
5. **Tech Talks** to share latest trends in the technology and improve public speaking skills.

### Community demographics

- **Size**: Target all students at IIIT-Allahabad i.e about 1500+. But mainly focus on 500+ of  freshmen, and sophomore altogether.
- **Age**: 18-22 years.
_ **Main Backgrounds**: Each course offered at IIITA.
- **Resources**: 
	- **Colleagues at Tech-Society**: Tech-Society colleagues are very enthusiastic about improving our community. I'm sure they will do all possible help to achieve program goals.
	- **GitHub organization**: To keep track of each of the desired goals, workshops, code sharing, interaction via issues.
	- **Gitter**: Channel for community discussion.  
Currently 

### Communication

We will use **Gitter** channel for community discussion apart from personal contact on twitter and facebook.

### Culture

Existing community is quite open to learning and sharing knowledge but is not organized for effective specific knowledge transfer like through hobby groups. Female participation in events, workshops is quite less compared to men. Existing community is little leaned towards competitive programming though things have changed in last few years. 


## Proposal

In the first 1 month of the program we will arrange a meetup, workshops for community bonding and to get in touch with the program via Gitter and educate them about the organization on GitHub.

### Timing

We will kick off the program in the ongoing fall semester. We will make the program available to everyone in a week of move in as Campus-Expert with the basic structure of organization and community channel laid down for smooth and easy communication for newcomers. Each following month will consist of workshop, quick-talk, hobby-group meetups. We will start working on community projects after a couple of workshops and quick-talks. We will use communication channel to take constructive feedback and iterate on plans as we organize more events for the program.

### Community Demographics

- **Hobby Groups**: Hobby groups will help us to create a diverse community with specific groups for trending technologies. This will also increase community interaction and knowledge transfer among students.
- **Workshops**: We will start workshops to educate students to use GitHub, Git and other open source tools. We will aim to create buzz about open source development and increase number contributors to open source projects.
- **Tech-Talks**: It will help us create buzz among the unreached section of the community. Tech-Talks will also help community geeks to increase public-speaking skills.
- **Girls Hackathon**: We will arrange Hackathon for Girls to increase female participation. It will be an amazing experience for the unreached female community and hopefully, it will generate interest that will keep them in touch with the program.

### Goals

Community impact goals are as follows:

- **Diverse Culture** with the help of Hobby Groups.
- **Increase in Interest & participation of women** via Girls Hackathon.
- **Increase in open source development** via workshops on open source tools and technologies.
- **Engagement with trending technologies & Improvement in public speaking skills** via 15-20 min. tech-talks.
- **Community projects** to help build cohesive and sharing community.

### Communication

- **Gitter channel** and **Facebook group** for the program to help students share their feedbacks and doubts.
- **GitHub organization** for the program to add and discuss issues related to the events, workshops.
- **Facebook** for personal communication.
- **Workshops**: Post workshop student interaction.
- **College Mailing list** for shooting event email to all students at once.

## Proposal's Impact 

### Target Audience

The program will mainly target freshmen, sophomore and all female students of IIITA campus. We will try to reach to maximum students via workshops, events, tech-talks.

### Community Needs

The program will focus on following needs:
- Creating diverse learning culture and a free flow of knowledge.
- Increase in women participation.

- Engagement with latest technologies.
- Improvement in public speaking skills.
- Community projects to help students work in teams.

###  Resources

The program will require following resources:

- Classrooms and Auditorium of the Institute.
- Swags for the Tech-Talks and Workshops through GitHub.
- Financial aid for the Girls Hackathon. We will try to get sponsorship from other companies + from GitHub.


### Media

I have discussed community impact proposal with my colleagues in the Technical Society. We will create awareness of the program via workshops, Facebook page of the technical society. I will deliver a keynote on plans to successfully implement all planned events with my colleagues at technical society and take help from them to reach a larger audience.

### Content Knowledge

I have leadership experience in organizing many Aparoksha(Technical Fest) events. As I'm the coordinator of Software Development Wing and have a fair share of open source experience, I feel I have enough technical skills to deliver workshops and Tech-Talks. Last year, I have delivered Tech-Talk and numerous workshops web-development workshops.

### Knowledge of participant needs

As coordinator of Software Development Wing and member of Hack In The North(Student held Hackathon), I have interacted with students and taken feedback to know their needs. Students have given many valuable suggestions to improve workshops and hackathon. We will interact with other experienced students to enhance the quality of the events.

### Timeline

- In the first week of the program, we will setup structure like Gitter Channel, Program Organization on GitHub etc for smooth communication and feedback system for newbies. Meetup and Keynote to reach people who will help in achieving program goals and reach a larger audience.
- In the first week of each month, we will arrange a workshop on open-source tools and technologies. In the 2nd week, we will arrange tech-talk on trending topics. We will organize hobby group meet up in the 3rd week of each month.
- We will organize Girls Hackathon in Feb after basic exposure to build new things.
- We will kick off community projects in the last week of November so students can work on the project in their semester breaks.  


## Planning for future

- Revision on an impact of the proposal will be done after the end of every 3 months to cross check the desired impact on community apart from post event assessment of each event and workshop.
- The measure of the success will be assessed by the number of new people joining the events, workshops and open source development. Importantly count of increase in women, freshmen participation in the events & number of community project that will be delivered at the end of 1 year.
- Each session which will span about 3 months. I will iterate on community plans at the end of each session.
