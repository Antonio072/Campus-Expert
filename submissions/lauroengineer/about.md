# Hello there everyone! üëã

My name is Lauro, I'm currently a first year undergraduate studying Computer Science at University of Monterrey in Mexico. I run/organise workshops and event at my university to build our hacker community, help students learn the skills that they're not getting in class and engage our community with fun activities.

Beyond that, I'm a regular participant, speaker and organiser at several meetups in our local tech community. Im especially interested in participating and promoting communities that champion diversity and inclusion in tech. 

I've been programing with Ruby and Ruby on Rails for about two years. Lately this year, I've been super into JavaScript frameworks, in particular I've been exploring React, Vue, GraphQL, and Node.
