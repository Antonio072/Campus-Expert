## Abstract
As a musician and programmer, I like building things, but wish I had more time to make music. Never fear, for we can make music with code! Use an npm module to string together notes, chords, and scales, building songs from music online as well as your own mind. The module is able to use obscure scales like hungarian gypsy and bebop dominant, and augmented and diminished scales, as well as more simple ones too.

## Description
This talk will have you digging into the code as a collective group since it is so easy to make music with this npm module. This talk will have no slidesâ€¦only live-code. String together notes, chords, and scales to make songs you recognize, and then, as a collective group, the audience will make your own melody together as a team.

## Notes
No technical requirements. I gave a version of this talk at QueensJS. You can find the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYDlVb1Jp2I](here).
