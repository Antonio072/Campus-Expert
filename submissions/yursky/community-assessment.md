## Assessing Freetail Hacker's Needs

### Definition
Freetail Hackers is a community of UT Austin students that encourages and empowers anyone who wants to build cool tech, learn new skills, meet new people, and become a part of the hacker community.

### Size
The facebook group for Freetail Hackers currently has 632 members at the time that I am writing this. However we don't feel as though we impact nearly that many people as closely as we want to. Our largest event, HackTX brings together about that many hackers into one place to learn together, but we don't end up doing as much as we want to facilitate our goals during the rest of the year. I guess in a weird way I hope for the community to become smaller and more close knit.

### Resources
As a group we organize multiple hackathons throughout the year. This serves as our main form of outreach and community engagement. I want to move towards more personal events like meetups for hackers going to certain hackathons or workshops. I feel like that will help in achieving the goal of introducing more people to the hacker community and not just hackathons in general.

### Accessibility
We mostly cater to other university students at our own school, because of that we try to keep our events and beginner friendly and open as possible. We don't want to scare people off or seem intimidating in any way. We tend to host our events in the evenings when it is not an all day event like a hackathon. In addition, we try to not keep anyone away from attending our hackathons due to cost limitations, so we do our best to facilitate those needs when they arise.

### Interests
Our community empowers all hackers in general! I'm really happy to see that we have hackers from all backgrounds, such as liberal arts and linguistics students along with music and business. During the second half of the year we try to put on a smaller niche hackathon that caters to a more specific interest group. So far, we have put on "Design Hacks" and "Music Hacks". We do our best to make an easy way to get into the community if you are not specifically an engineering or computer science major.

### Goals
- Empower student hackers. (Over-arching goal)
- Teach important practical applications of CS concepts to students.
- Create a welcoming community of hackers that allow anyone curious to participate.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
- How will you personally handle it?
