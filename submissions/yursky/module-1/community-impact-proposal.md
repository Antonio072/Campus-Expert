## Summary of the Community's Needs

[Freetail Hackers](https://freetailhackers.com/) is a large and wide spread community that encompasses a lot of different sub groups. At 631 online members it is already a large community. We organize workshops, meetups, and hackathons for the student community at the **University of Texas at Austin**. We facilitate most of our community wide communication through online channels just as mailing lists or [facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/freetail/). Because of this, the culture within the group is not as close knit as I would like it to be. We are an extremely open community the reaches out to a lot of parts of campus to find people interested in hacker culture but I think we don't do enough to bring them together afterward. I feel like we need to do more to develop conversations that people have at our in person events and meetups and continue them outside of the planned spaces. Community engagement drops off significantly right after we have a meetup and I feel like we need to do something about it.

Some statistics for throughout the history of the facebook group:
- **67 posts**
- **23 authors**
- **29 commenters**
- **155 reactors**

Looking at the history of posts on the FB group we see that things drastically die down during break periods and when we don't have planned events. While this pattern is expected, I believe that effects this drastic show an underlying issue in the way we run the group.

My proposal for bringing the Freetail Hackers community closer together centers around bringing more **social events** to the group. I think one of the biggest reasons that things tend to die out and not become more personal at our events is that they are not a conducive social atmosphere. Hackathons are great for meeting other individuals if they are of a more casual nature. But if there are big prizes on the line or if they have a strongly competitive atmosphere to them, it becomes difficult to socialize with hackers from other teams.

In addition, workshops are a great format for learning about new things and getting hands on experience with a mentor nearby. But again, it doesn't facilitate meaningful discussions between attendees of the event.


## The Proposal

#### Plan of Attack 👊

Since *bringing more social events to the community*  is the overall goal, I see a few different styles of event to have.

1. **Texas Traveling Hacker Meetups**
2. **Technology Oriented Meetups**
3. **More casual events such as board game nights**

##### Texas Traveling Hacker Meetups

Most hackathons in Texas have a great relationship with each and send buses to other schools to bring hackers over to their own events. Since we are one of the largest universities in the state and have a pretty active traveling hacker community we are very lucky to almost always have at least one bus stop by our campus. I think it would be great if we could get all UT hackers that will be traveling to various other Texas hackathons to meet up around a week before the event to get to know other students that will be traveling with them whether on the bus or otherwise. This accomplish a few goals:

- natural team formation
- cross team communication
- ideation
- community development through a more casual environment

I think this would be a great way to accomplish all of these things. In addition, this would provide a fun way to develop the Freetail Hacker member identity by perhaps handing out event oriented or community oriented swag such as stickers on board the bus to event. This would help members of Freetail Hackers to recognize others at the event that are traveling with them and function as a sort of badge of honor/camaraderie. (This sounds so cool to me. 😁)

| Hackathon | Date                                    
| ---|---:                          
| HackTX | Oct 28-29                           
| HackRice | Sep 22-24
| HackUTA | Sep 30 - Oct 1
| TamuHack | TBA
| RowdyHacks | TBA
| HackWesTx | TBA
| RGV Hackathon? | TBA

These are the dates of most of the major Texas hackathons that come to mind for me. It would be ideal if we could have a meetup before each one. 🙌

[Florida Hackers](http://www.floridahackers.com/) is an existing community of cross school hackers that is extremely successful in bringing together hackers in a greater community. There are quite a few things that can be taken from them as examples on how to implement something like this well.

##### Tech Oriented Meetups

Tech oriented meetups would facilitate to bring together hackers excited about a specific technology. These would be structured differently from workshops as they would not have a required program to demand attention from attendees. Instead, these would facilitate group discussions to bring other students together.

These could also be integrated with existing hackathons that we put on in a "week of hacks" scenario leading up to the event.

Another scenario where these events could be implemented is whenever certain technologies hit the news or a big announcement is made. These discussions could be made to facilitate discussions related to just that topic. For example, at the time of writing this OpenAI just built an AI successfully beat one of the worlds best Dota 2 players in a 1v1 competition. It would be awesome to have a meetup with discussion points prepared about the significance of this achievement.

I think these type of meetups work well for broad categories of interest and not smaller more specific ones. Mostly because its harder to gather together a group of people who have a very specific field of interest.

**Some topics and ideas**:

- Machine Learning
- Security
- Web Development
- Games Development
- Hardware Hacking

I think the most important thing is to gauge interest from our existing community before going forward and starting a program similar to this. We would need to see what interests the community has beforehand.

**Timeline**:

1. Survery interest within the first week of the semester
2. Reassess after preliminary data arrives.

##### Casual/Fun Meetups! 🎲 🎮

The idea here would be to host meetups where all we do is play board games, hang out, or just talk. This is a weird idea because I feel like it treads dangerously close to not fulfilling the goals of the original community.

Another avenue to approach this idea from is to bring things like board games and video games to existing meetups for traveling hackers or tech topics as discussed above. What this may accomplish is provide another bonding and ice breaker experience to attendees at our events.

While it is true that people have multiple interests and oftentimes these overlap in communities such as this, I feel like it would be almost rude to tread on the toes of an existing community. This is definitely an idea that I would want to discuss with others before considering it any further.

## Your Proposal's Impact

- *Target audience*
  - Students interested in hacker culture at UT 🤘
- *Community needs*
  - The lack of personal relationships and 1 on 1 interactions created by Freetail Hackers.
- Resources
  - We don't need much to accomplish our goals. The only things I could imagine needing are stickers for distribution to traveling hackers and any resources we might need to give workshops
  - We have funds set aside for community outreach at our event!
- Media
  - We will perform outreach through various social media streams. (fb, twitter)
  - Hopefully we will just need to create the custom assets for the events that we want to host and go from there. If we need to do any specialized outreach or community focusing that will become evident during a later check in period.
- Content knowledge
  - I have a lot of personal experience with hosting workshops and leading ice breaker sessions for new groups of people so hopefully I will be able to identify any pain points that arise throughout hosting our events.
  - I think the most valuable method of developing knowledge related to these topics would be hosting these meetups. In terms of technical knowledge for putting on hackathons, I have the whole interwebs at my disposal! 🕸

## Planning for the Future

We will review the performance of current strategy in late October immediately following HackTX.

It will be difficult to create an objective metric for measurement the success of this project. Activity on the fb group is a way of measuring success however not completely indicative of the overall activity in the community at large. I think it will be mostly a question of how the community feels as a whole after the event. Maybe a survey or some other method of gathering concrete data may be more effective.

Hopefully we will be able to succeed in building more personal interactions in Freetail Hackers!
