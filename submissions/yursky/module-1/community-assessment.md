## Assessing Freetail Hacker's Needs

### Definition
Freetail Hackers is a community of UT Austin students that encourages and empowers anyone who wants to build cool tech, learn new skills, meet new people, and become a part of the hacker community.

### Size
The facebook group for [Freetail Hackers](https://freetailhackers.com/) currently has 631 members at the time that I am writing this. However we don't feel as though we impact nearly that many people as closely as we want to. Our largest event, HackTX brings together about that many hackers into one place to learn together, but we don't end up doing as much as we want to facilitate our goals during the rest of the year. I guess in a weird way I hope for the community to become smaller and more close knit.

### Resources
As a group we organize multiple hackathons throughout the year. This serves as our main form of outreach and community engagement. I want to move towards more personal events like meetups for hackers going to certain hackathons or workshops. I feel like that will help in achieving the goal of introducing more people to the hacker community and not just hackathons in general.

### Accessibility
We mostly cater to other university students at our own school, because of that we try to keep our events as beginner friendly and open as possible. We don't want to scare people off or seem intimidating in any way. We tend to host our events in the evenings when it is not an all day event like a hackathon. In addition, we try to not keep anyone away from attending our hackathons due to cost limitations, so we do our best to facilitate those needs when they arise.

### Interests
Our community empowers all hackers in general! I'm really happy to see that we have hackers from all backgrounds, such as liberal arts and linguistics students along with music and business. During the second half of the year we try to put on a smaller niche hackathon that caters to a more specific interest group. So far, we have put on "Design Hacks" and "Music Hacks". We do our best to make an easy way to get into the community if you are not specifically an engineering or computer science major.

### Goals
- Empower student hackers. (Over-arching goal)
- Teach important practical applications of CS concepts to students.
- Create a welcoming community of hackers that allow anyone curious to participate.

### Location
Freetail Hackers is centered at the University of Texas at Austin, because of that we have a lot of meetings and workshops in and around the campus area. In addition, we reach out to a lot of other hackathons in the Texas area in an attempt to create a positive relationship in the greater Texas community.

Much of the campus is really accommodating in terms of accessibility and amenities such as food and other needs that people might have. However parking is a major issue since we are in the middle of a major downtown area.

It would be awesome if we could open up these meetups and workshops that we conduct to the greater Austin tech community. However, I'm not completely sure on the university policy regarding this. I think that would a do a lot towards opening up our goals to those that aren't just students.

### Communication
Our main method of communication is on campus announcements and our facebook group. We have another dedicated facebook group, twitter account, and email list for all of our attendees of our flagship event, HackTX. I feel like it would be better to have a more direct or in person method of communication. In my opinion, word of mouth is always the best way to spread ideas.

### Culture
We welcome any and everyone interested in hacker culture! There is a place for everyone's skillset at a hackathon, the hard part comes with finding like minded people or finding a niche where you can meet others just as interested as yourself. We make a lot of our community and direction decisions as a team inside of our leadership committee. We have excellent conditions in place for when we internally disagree within the leadership team as a whole. However, I think one of our biggest weak points is being a little out of touch with the general opinion of all of our community members. A lot of our personal interactions occur during workshops or one on one debugging sessions at our events.

A code of conduct serves to create a promise of what members can expect when participating in the community. Things like the [Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/) provide a rigorous framework for making sure that all members of the community have the right to feel included.
