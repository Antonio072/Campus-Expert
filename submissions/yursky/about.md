# About Yuriy

Hello! My name is Yuriy and I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.
I love going to hackathons and organizing them. The reason I'm in the tech community now is because of an experience I had at my first
hackathon. Now I am dedicated to helping other people find the same sense of community that I felt at my first hackathon!

## Interests

I love taking new ideas in technology and finding cool ways to incorporate them into other projects or designs. I've worked
on a product architecture and research group at Workday that took cool new design patterns in tech and proved that they worked
for business applications. It was really fun because it was like a small hackathon inside of a bigger company.

In my free time I like bouldering and long walks on the beach.
