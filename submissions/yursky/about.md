# About Yuriy

Hello! My name is Yuriy and I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.
I love going to hackathons and organizing them. The reason I'm in the tech community now is because of an experience I had at my first
hackathon. Now I am dedicated to helping other people find the same sense of community that I felt at my first hackathon!

## Interests

I love taking new ideas in technology and finding cool ways to incorporate them into other projects or designs. I've worked on a product architecture and research group at Workday that took cool new design patterns in tech and proved that they worked for business applications. It was really fun because it was like a small hackathon inside of a bigger company.

At UT Austin I am a member of Freetail Hackers where we try to encourage other students to be active hackers in the greater Texas community and develop their technical skills at home by giving workshops and putting on our own hackathons.

In my free time I like bouldering at the gym because I want to squeeze all of the value I can out of my membership. I also read a lot of fantasy novels and play Dungeons and Dragons every week! üé≤
