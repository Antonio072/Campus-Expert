# About @dannycjones

I'm Danny. I'm 20 studying Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, UK. I'm now entering my third year at the time of writing (Autumn '17). I'm cofounder of [HackSheffield society](https://hack.sheffield.ac.uk/) which runs hackathons and related events in the university.

I'm really excited to introduce new people to tech and reduce the barriers that can form to those with less experience. _Reducto, imposter syndrome._

I'm super proud of what my team (old and new) have done so far with the society, and wish to build on that and on myself in terms of technical writing and speaking skills.

## Technical Interests

I really enjoy working on web-based projects which of course entails JavaScript. I like to use the terminal where possible, always use git with any development I do, and I'd always love to learn something new.
