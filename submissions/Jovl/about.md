Hey guys :wave:
My name is Jeremiah Lantzer and I'm currently a Junior in Software Engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. 
We do Airplane stuff. During the day I'm a student/research assistant and by night I'm one of those people who stays up all night at random colleges all over the country writing code with friends. I'm involved with Florida Hackers and a new club on my campus called TechEagles.

## Interests
I really like taking pictures and yeah...code.
Travelling is pretty cool too.
