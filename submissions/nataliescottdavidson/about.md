### Hello everyone! 
My name is Natalie, and I am a sophomore computer science student at the University of South Carolina.

I am a member of women in computing at my university. Outside of software engineering, I spend my time running, biking, 
swimming, and reading.

My experience so far is in enterprise software development, however I am interested in exploring high performance computing,
low-level architectures, and programming for GPUs. 

My favorite emoji is the "yikes" :grimacing: emoji, it is so useful.
