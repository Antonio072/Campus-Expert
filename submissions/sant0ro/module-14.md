## UIoT's Web Page

### Current version

We designed a large Internet of Things Open Source alpha concept web page using ZURB's Foundation as CSS and JavaScript Framework.
And used Jekyll also.

**The design it's inspired on a flat matter.**

The **alpha** concept of the web page can be seen:
1. By accessing this web page: https://uiot.org (served on our servers, built with Jekyll)
2. Acessing this branch on the UIoT's website repository: https://github.com/uiot/uiot.github.io/tree/alpha

### Future work

We're creating our own design schema and identity, for the Internet of Things Project called UIoT.
You can actually get some earlier alpha concepts made purely in HTML here:

1. https://github.com/uiot/uiot.github.io/
2. https://uiot.github.io

We're now migrating the HTML code to a Jekyll code and designing the other modules. Other parts of the web site
are available as an example on http://docs.uiot.org

### Inspiration

Inspired by Swagger UI schema, our design identity it's adapted with out color schema, and some Swagger UI changes. Using ZURB's Foundation
as CSS and JavaScript framework.
