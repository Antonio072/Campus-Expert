## Why, How and What Contribute

It's a really though question knowing how, what and why you would contribute to an open souce repository. In my personal and professional opinion I will give some explanations, maybe they help you on your open source career.

### How

1. Only contribute something that you really think that it's useful for everyone. Changing code that only will benefit you isn't good.
2. Make sure that what are you changing will not broke earlier versions, as example, using methods or language resources that are only available on newest versions on the language/involved libraries or frameworks.
  * It's useful to know that when more versions, operational systems the software works, better is.
  * try to commit codes that are documented, test-oriented like [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and clean. Keep an eye about code complexion and performance, new features or changes/improvements cannot decrease the performance or reablity of the software. Give a look about the [Big-O Table](http://bigocheatsheet.com).

### Why

Contributing isn't something that you do for **status**. You contribute to spread and share knowledge and to help the community. Generally softwares are used by people that doesn't have right now the knowledge to improve the software, so you not matter who you are, if you know how to help they, why noy?

### What

Generally when you create something (specifically we're saying about softwares hehe) you use libraries and frameworks made by other people/communities (or made by you too), so generally you start to contribute to repositories involving libraries, tools, frameworks that you are familiar to. And generally you contribute when you think that some changes can increase and/or benefit you and the community. Don't be afraid for trying to contribute to large repositories like [Citra Emulator](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra). But make sure that you read the contribution guides and that you have the knowledge of doing it. Large repositories require more professional stuff, because of that, try starting with smallest ones, they will give you the experience and education to do more! But not be afraid, small repositories also are important!
