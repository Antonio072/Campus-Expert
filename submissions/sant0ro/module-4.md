# An Internet of Things Workshop
Welcome to our first **Internet of Things** workshop! Let's get started?

## About this Workshop

This workshop it's provided by the [Universal Internet of Things](https://github.com/uiot) organization. And intend to all audiences.
This workshop will cover the following topics:

Topic   | Duration | Description |
--------|----------|-------------|
What's Internet of Things?  | 20m | This topic will cover a brief introduction of what's the Internet of Things. And how they are important and how they will interact on our day-a-day scenario. |
Let's get started | 15m | This topic it's about you downloading and preparing your environment with all what you need. |
Creating your RESTful API | 40m | This topic it's about developing a simple CRUD RESTful API to store data, and devices metadatas. |
Preparing your Hardware | 30m | This topic it's about download the UIoT's KernelOS(DeviceOS) and try to test with your new API! |
Coffee Break & Finish | 40m | Finish what you need, present to your colleagues what you got, and let's eat some snacks. |

### Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you probably will:

* Understand what are smart objects, smart homes, Internet of Things, and how chocolate it's great. &#10004;
* How the Internet of Things will change the world. &#10004;
* How to code a simple RESTful API &#10004;
* How to **don't break** arduinos. &#10004;
* Eat delicious snacks. :hamburger:

### Meet the Teachers

The workshop it's presented by **Claudio Santoro** (coordinator) and the **UIoT** team.

[Claudio](http://santoro.pw) and the [UIoT team](https://uiot.org) are members of an open source Internet of Things organization that aims to create
a full open source, scalable, distributed, cognitive and universal internet of things platform;middleware and architecture. 

## The Workshop

### Introduction üëã

#### TL;DL

The term Internet of Things (often abbreviated IoT) was coined by industry researchers but has emerged into mainstream public view only more recently. 
Some claim the Internet of Things will completely transform how computer networks are used for the next 10 or 100 years, 
while others believe IoT is simply hype that won't much impact the daily lives of most people.

#### What's IoT

Internet of Things represents a general concept for the ability of network devices to sense and collect data from the world around us, and then share that data across the Internet where it can be processed and utilized for various interesting purposes.

Some also use the term industrial Internet interchangeably with IoT. 
This refers primarily to commercial applications of IoT technology in the world of manufacturing.
The Internet of Things is not limited to industrial applications, however.

### Applications (Demonstrations & Examples)  üëç

Some future consumer applications envisioned for IoT sound like science fiction, but some of the more practical and realistic sounding possibilities for the technology include:

* Receiving warnings on your phone or wearable device when IoT networks detect some physical danger is detected nearby
self-parking automobiles
* Automatic ordering of groceries and other home supplies
* Automatic tracking of exercise habits and other day-to-day personal activity including goal tracking and regular progress reports

**Potential benefits of IoT in the business world include:**

* Location tracking for individual pieces of manufacturing inventory
* Fuel savings from intelligent environmental modeling of gas-powered engines
* New and improved safety controls for people working in hazardous environments

### Learners First üéìü•á

Firstly, a workshop is not just a long lecture: the focus is on the attendees doing work. 
During a workshop, students will learn from you, but they will also learn from a variety of other sources. 
They will learn from themselves: prompt them to consider their past experiences and help them frame those experiences with 
new information. They will learn from each other, sharing and developing ideas with one another. 
They will learn from practice, you will give them work to complete and ways to experiment with the knowledge you're delivering. 
Be humble, and bring the focus to the student, not to you.

Secondly, sharing previous experiences helps you pace your content. 
Knowing where everyone is coming from, how much they already know about the topic, or where they've previously learnt, 
is an enormous resource. It will readily identify to you the advanced student who you may be able to lean on to support the others. 
It will let you know you can probably gloss over the first 10 minutes you'd planned, and go into more detail later.
Or equally, that you might want to avoid a certain advanced topic. Knowing the students motivations is also vital. 
As we cover in the public speaking module, a solution isn't interesting unless it solves one of our problems. 
Knowing why your students are interested in this material will help you frame it in an engaging way, and relate it to their experiences.

### What you got after accomplishing it? :airplane:

You got a **certificate** that you finished it. And the three best groups will receive an Arduino Starter Kit.

### Q&A - FAQS

* **Q:** What happens if someone falls behind, how do you bring them back up to speed with everyone else?
* **A:** If the people falls behind, some things can be done depending of how the subject it's acting
  * If the subject it's not anymore interested on what the workshop does, this can be:
     * The subject doesn't liked the way of the teachers are doing it
     * The subject though IoT or Microservices were different things
     * It's more interested in using his smartphone because of anxiety or distraction, some members have disabilities like autism or TDAH (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) and we need give they a special treatment.
   * the subject it's having troubles doing the workshop things
      * We can try to give special attention
      * explain things again, or reformulate the way of explaining
      * try giving to the subject another use case or way of comprehension.
* **Q:** How do you get people interacting together rather than silently following your instructions.
* **A:** The teachers aren't only me, If you see, other UIoT members would be part of it. I didn't added they because they aren't doing the Campus Experts Training, and this should be a privacy violation. (_Remembering.: I'm not only a student on my university, I'm also a researcher. So teaching it's something that I do really often._) Also the groups will interact by theyself, we will just give the instructions, examples, explain and give support, also we will encourage the people to do the things.
* **Q:** What happens if you have all 180 people turn up? Maybe you want to cap the workshop at 15 people so you can help everyone, or maybe you have some others who can help run the workshop and help people that need it.
* **A:** Some faults on my "Workshop example" was not giving more specific details about the sessions, but depending of the personnel, I think 30 max students/members by session it's sufficient. Remebering, IoT it's a surging area, and not many people know about it. Also developing complex things require time, attention and care.
* **Q:** What will you do if most people that turn up don't know what REST is? Have you accounted for some space to explain it so they'll understand what they're doing.
* **A:** Since REST and other key-terms are the fundamentals of what will be covered on the workshop, it's not really necessary knowing REST or either IoT. Anyone can be part of the workshop and we will ensure that the entirely guides and theory terms will be given. Also we will give little "state-of-art" and brief resum√©s of what it's each things. Teams will be free to choose programming languages, and we will try to give support to many of it. Our meta, it's use technologies available on many language as possible. Like BigInteger, JWT, Tree Algorithms, HTTP Frameworks, and more.
* **Q:** How will they continue their learning after the workshop.
* **A:** Learning gives practice. The groups after finishing it will be invited to be part of an International Internet of Things open source organization. Also if some teams didn't finished up in one session, they can go to others. We will encourage that applying on the daily life scenario it's something important.
