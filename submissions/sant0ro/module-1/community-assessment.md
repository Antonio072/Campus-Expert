### Definition

How define a **community**? That's a really though question. What we can really try it's define the variables (those social emotions) that make your hearth _pump_ for your friends. The community were I live, in a _"grand"_ scenario, it's the whole Brazil country. A country thatr faces many, many problems for technology development and for enroll and development of tech communities. Not because we don't have excellent academics, researchers or students. But we are not **encouraged** to do it. A really different scenario from the developed (and first class) countries. Our government doesn't incentive research, while many countries has tons of tons of open editals and engineering/tech conferences enveloped by organs like [IEEE](https://ieee.org) or private companies, like GitHub itself. That doesn't happen here.

But isn't budget that defines a **community** but the passion of their members of trying to understand this scenario and propose continuous changes. That's define **an enrolled community**.

How define the tech community on the University of Brasília? Discouraged, out of order, and overspreaded (not on the good meaning).

But that's how the things are because of the situation of the members of itself. We don't have an unique technology group ou society. We have many, but those communities are limited to its members and have a really hard duty on gathering new members. Out of money, out of divulgation, out of marketing... Those communities tries to survive, like the IEEE Computer Society, or IEEE Computer Communications Society, even the IEEE Internet of Things community. We have all there, but they're represented by IEEE and doesn't can act with force here.

We actually have many events that are **awesome** like the Seeds of the Future provided by Huawei. But that's rare.

My focus, and focus of many other students it's gather new members and create a new member accessible by anyone. Not only students of the University of Brasília. We need be participative, open connected, and passion with technology, as a hobby, as passion and love.

Actually we're trying to create a greater group "The Information Technology Students Group over Brazil", actually with 176 members from Brazil-wide. That's my goal, and of the members of this community. 

Create events, conferences, hackatons, dialogue, study, and more. Because my community isn't my Collegue. Today with technology our community hasn't anymore frontiers, only if you want to.

### Size

Actually we have 180~ members on our community, that it's maintained by a Telegram Super Group. We really want to increase those frontier, and create events spreaded over Brazil, actually our main focus it's Brasília and Federal District of Brazil, since the Administrators of the group come from it. But we incentive the spread of technology events, knowledge and more in Brazil-wide. We need be united. I don't want fix a limit of members, when more members, better, more people to help. More people to participate. We have rules. And we follow it. The groups it's like some months old, three or four, we started with 5 members, and with 3 months we actually have 180~. We want to increase our size and create a familly based community.

### Resources

We actually spread Technology resources, guides, webinars, links to courses, discounts in courses, Campus Party resources, live stream videos, hackatons invites, and we actually solve problems and questions of everyone on the group. The community it's a big family, we help each other. We spread everything that we get, and everything that we search, we focus on improve the tech and social capabilities of all members, without exception.

### Accessibility

We focus on Hangouts based meetings or physical meetings. The times have a big variety, but we focus on weekend were people doesn't work. We also focus on helping people to get over the place with community transport or with rides.

### Interests

Our community it's based for any IT base field, that means Engineering, Analysts, Scientist, and more. Also not only students can enter on the community. Obviously the group it's focused for **students**, because students are strictly focused in academics and research. But anyone that love tech can enter, why not? Our topics aren't only specifically **tech** but politics, health, education topics that are relevant or involved with tech. Since social skills are important.

### Goals

People mainly get involded by curiosity, but they know also because it's discussed and spreaded over the net. A great part of our members are students hoping to get a degree, and we try to ensure that they would get. We also incredibly try to help with Calculus, awesome yeah? We also spread job opportunities and job related content on the community, we also give hiring tips and tries to answer any possible question. We explain also the fields of IT working, like Data Scientist, DevOps, Security DevOps, those fields that are rapidly getting famous on companies and we try to answer any related question to those fields. Many of they are passionate of developing, we answer coding questions on the group and focus on "learn-oriented-development", so we mainly doesn't try to solve the question but help the member to understand the problem and got the question solved by itself (with the help of the members). We have many activities, as explained before. But our goals? Simple, just one. "Be a big familly".

### Location

On the web, specifically Telegram. But in the future: GitHub + Blog + Website. We have many places to meet, literally, any. Restaurants, Laboratories in the University, Shopping, Event based locations, and more. Parking it's free. We also provide rides. Yeah we only try to create meetings were everyone can easily go to it, mainly with public transport. The location it's accessible both on and off campus. Also if the member isn't a student of the University we get special access to it. The place it's absolutely **FREE** (woah). Depending on were we do the meetings, we have different materials. Sometimes in Auditoriums, Laboratories, also sometimes in Picnics hehe. Since our members are spread over the country, we try to create pools asking who can go on it, and allocating space based on the amount of people. Yes, we focus in comfort, but we only can give what the University of the other locals provides. We have free water, but we doesn't actually have enough budget to provide snacks. Also we doesn't have our **community** HQ. We use many spaces.

### Communication

We get touch by Telegram. It's easy to use and accessible in any device (or pratically any, except in your watch.. I mean also it's!) We in the future will create a Facebook group, GitHub organization and website.

### Culture

Our community it's in stage of development, we accept 100% new ideas, but those need be discussed and approved democratically. When happens a disagreement we follow the rules of the group and recommendations, depending of what happens we try to do a formal discouragement or a simple dialogue. Sometimes mute or block need be executed, this depends on the severity of the discouragement. All our policies are documented and available at GitHub.
