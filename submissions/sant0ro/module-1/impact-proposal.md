## Summary of the Community's Needs

Learn.. learning it's an endless journey.

Putting all those definitions and questions on paper was a good maner to meditate about the community I belong to. And so I finish questioning about it, and there are the conclusions.

### Community dempographics

The community at explained before it's open to everyone, firstly on Brazil, since english isn't something fluent/native present in ever Brazilian. As an example, I'm not Brazilian, but german. Some people have difficulty on english, so if some content is in English we try to translate or port in a maner that everyone (or 99.9%) can understand it.

The community focus on Students, and it's mainly composed by Computer Science students, we also have already graded Engineers and Computer Scientists, also we have Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering students. We also have people that hasn't started their academic path (on high school or even on school, lol). (This isn't a **big** problem, but we face many "problems" since some people that actually are on high school don't even know what is a Hackaton, but we work in a maner that everyone can understand it.).. Sadly we have some scam members on the community. Those that says that knows everything or are part of groups like Anonymous, but obviously aren't part of it..

Diversity it's our main focus. But if some member broke the rules... We need apply the correct countermeasures. We focus on honest members that want to improve theirself or each other.

Our community also have veterans, in age, or in professional manner, or also in education. (People with doctorate).

### Communication

Our community mainly communicates through our [Telegram](https://t.me/ComputerScientistBr) group. We communicate with pools, normal dialogues, forms and more. We also communicate physically through events, hackatons, and encounters. It's simple, but works. (Obviously we want to create more ways of communication).

### Culture

Our cultuer it's a lot **diversified**, really. We have people from many different IT areas, students, non-students, olders, youngers, milleniums, and woah, a really big **set** of cultures (asian, portuguese, brazilian, german... a ton.).

We focus on equality of genre and of culture, in terms of preservation and respect. But we don't create quotas for genres or cultures. Everyone it's invited. Our culture it's focused in [learning, familly, prosperity].

## Your Proposal

That's a thoug question :bowtie:

### Timing

Timing it's important. Our members are from many different Universities, and each one with their schedules. We mainly focus in creating events or inviting events based on a flex calendar. That means, when the majority of the group can enjoy the events. Also in periods that are vacations for both (we actually have a good intersection of vacations periods). During the semester, we focus on weekends. 

### Community Demographics

Actually I think that our diversity it's in a great rate, what I propose, it's simple. Continue on focusing on "everyone it's welcome", no restriction.

### Goals

Oh, I have so many goals, many of these are similar and the same of the other Administrators, and my focus it's create a set of ideas that can tange the needings of almost every member of the community.

Like adopt the usage of shared Google Calendar, official website using GitHub Pages. A Blog with content, and many other things related to organization, logistics and features, like as an example Telegram bots. Simple things make a great difference.

### Communication

I propose creation also of Gamming Channels, like Teamspeak, Discord, and meetings through Hangouts or even Teamspeak, why not? We also are thinking on the possibility of creating channels inside the own Telegram group. If the group becomes more heavier than actually exists we need think in a way of not creating excessive spam or difficulties about communication. Importante notices need to spread to everyone. That are both hard things. And only living those situations will teach to us.

## Your Proposal's Impact

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - **Q:** Who are you expecting to impact based on your proposal?
  - **A:** I'm targeting everyone, or at least 99% of the community. It's hard to know if you're doing the right thing, more study need to be accomplished and only the time can say if we're actually doing the right thing. The PMI (Project Management Institute) already have many ways documented over the PMBOK of how effectively you're doing the right thing, and the best thing.
- Community needs
  - **Q:** What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
  - **A:** Plurality, Communication, Effort, Culture.
- Resources
  - **Q:** What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
  - **A:** This a really hard question, since we have only few resources, most of they can be obtained with the GitHub Student Pack and GitHub features itself. But a HQ or a place that we can effectively call home? That involves budget, something hard.
  - **Q:** How will you obtain those resources?
  - **A:** GitHub it's about collaboration and community. We try apply those principles on our community in order to with a democratic and organized way obtain further resources. Also we hope GitHub staff help us.. yeah?
- Media
  - **Q:** How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
  - **A:** Actually we only communicate through Telegram, but we will implement a Blog (I think Jekyll it's great), to post internal, external, events, discussions, polls and notes through the community.
  - **Q:** What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
  - **A:** As explained, Blogs, Teamspeak and Telegram Bots (to create a Table of Contents of important things to read).
- Content knowledge
  - **Q:** How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
  - **A:** If someone enter in some complex field or topic, and someone doesn't understand we try to explain theorically and practically depending on the knowledge level of who asked. We also by defauly try to spread knowledge in a proper easy way to understand.
  - **Q:** What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
  - **A:** The whole web, it's this not enough? My dear friend IEEE, Springer, ScienceDirect, the members, Wikipedia oh and more :)
- Timeline
  - **Q:** Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.
  - **A:** Here we go: https://app.mindmup.com/map/_free/2017/08/c8279c607fa511e7a8f7f9bdddfd3d74

## Planning for the Future

- **Q:** When will you review the impact of your proposal?
- **A:** When we have further progress, we intend to monthly create reports of how the community it's going.
- **Q:** How will you measure success?
- **A:** PMBOK5 here we go!
- **Q:** How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
- **A:** Like a Scrum Master would. xD
