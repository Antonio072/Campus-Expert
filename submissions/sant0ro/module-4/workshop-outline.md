# An Internet of Things Workshop
Welcome to our first **Internet of Things** workshop! Let's get started?

## About this Workshop

This workshop it's provided by the [Universal Internet of Things](https://github.com/uiot) organization. And intend to all audiences.
This workshop will cover the following topics:

Topic   | Duration | Description |
--------|----------|-------------|
What's Internet of Things?  | 20m | This topic will cover a brief introduction of what's the Internet of Things. And how they are important and how they will interact on our day-a-day scenario. |
Let's get started | 15m | This topic it's about you downloading and preparing your environment with all what you need. |
Creating your RESTful API | 40m | This topic it's about developing a simple CRUD RESTful API to store data, and devices metadatas. |
Preparing your Hardware | 30m | This topic it's about download the UIoT's KernelOS(DeviceOS) and try to test with your new API! |
Coffee Break & Finish | 40m | Finish what you need, present to your colleagues what you got, and let's eat some snacks. |

### Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you probably will:

* Understand what are smart objects, smart homes, Internet of Things, and how chocolate it's great. &#10004;
* How the Internet of Things will change the world. &#10004;
* How to code a simple RESTful API &#10004;
* How to **don't break** arduinos. &#10004;
* Eat delicious snacks. :hamburger:

### Meet the Teachers

The workshop it's presented by **Claudio Santoro** (coordinator) and the **UIoT** team.

[Claudio](http://santoro.pw) and the [UIoT team](https://uiot.org) are members of an open source Internet of Things organization that aims to create
a full open source, scalable, distributed, cognitive and universal internet of things platform;middleware and architecture. 

## The Workshop

### Introduction üëã

#### TL;DL

The term Internet of Things (often abbreviated IoT) was coined by industry researchers but has emerged into mainstream public view only more recently. 
Some claim the Internet of Things will completely transform how computer networks are used for the next 10 or 100 years, 
while others believe IoT is simply hype that won't much impact the daily lives of most people.

#### What's IoT

Internet of Things represents a general concept for the ability of network devices to sense and collect data from the world around us, and then share that data across the Internet where it can be processed and utilized for various interesting purposes.

Some also use the term industrial Internet interchangeably with IoT. 
This refers primarily to commercial applications of IoT technology in the world of manufacturing.
The Internet of Things is not limited to industrial applications, however.

### Applications (Demonstrations & Examples)  üëç

Some future consumer applications envisioned for IoT sound like science fiction, but some of the more practical and realistic sounding possibilities for the technology include:

* Receiving warnings on your phone or wearable device when IoT networks detect some physical danger is detected nearby
self-parking automobiles
* Automatic ordering of groceries and other home supplies
* Automatic tracking of exercise habits and other day-to-day personal activity including goal tracking and regular progress reports

**Potential benefits of IoT in the business world include:**

* Location tracking for individual pieces of manufacturing inventory
* Fuel savings from intelligent environmental modeling of gas-powered engines
* New and improved safety controls for people working in hazardous environments

### Learners First üéìü•á

Firstly, a workshop is not just a long lecture: the focus is on the attendees doing work. 
During a workshop, students will learn from you, but they will also learn from a variety of other sources. 
They will learn from themselves: prompt them to consider their past experiences and help them frame those experiences with 
new information. They will learn from each other, sharing and developing ideas with one another. 
They will learn from practice, you will give them work to complete and ways to experiment with the knowledge you're delivering. 
Be humble, and bring the focus to the student, not to you.

Secondly, sharing previous experiences helps you pace your content. 
Knowing where everyone is coming from, how much they already know about the topic, or where they've previously learnt, 
is an enormous resource. It will readily identify to you the advanced student who you may be able to lean on to support the others. 
It will let you know you can probably gloss over the first 10 minutes you'd planned, and go into more detail later.
Or equally, that you might want to avoid a certain advanced topic. Knowing the students motivations is also vital. 
As we cover in the public speaking module, a solution isn't interesting unless it solves one of our problems. 
Knowing why your students are interested in this material will help you frame it in an engaging way, and relate it to their experiences.
