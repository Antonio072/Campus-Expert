# Community moderation case study

In this exercise, you will analyse an example of community moderation in light of the techniques you have learnt in this module.

## Task

### Analyse a community you do not manage.

Past years I participate in a MMO Development Community called [RaGEZONE](http://forum.ragezone.com), a Community that I participate and being active
since 2014, and member since 2011. The moderation on this community that it's a forum it's clean, and correct. Mainly "perfect".

But many incidents already happened, one of those happened directly with me, when a moderator abused of power. 
The nature was about me creating an answer that the moderator didn't liked, and with it directly banned me. They gave me an warning about my actions, and banned me.
The outcome on the final was positively, since the forum allows to banned users create reclamations or enter with resources.
The administrator of the forum unbanned me on the end of the situation.

### Analyse a community you manage.

In the community that I moderate, specifically the community of case study on the "module-1", already some incidents happened. One of those was really weird.
A new member entered on the group and asked were are the rules and how to follow them. Another member made a joke saying "you already broke those haha".
The other member didn't liked it, and started to fight with it. The solution of the moderation, in the case myself, was quickly and fast.
I intervened being polite and trying to suggest that those behaviours aren't correct and tried to explain the rules, 
the outcome was good, since one of the members really didn't give so much care from the bad words that the other member was saying to him.

In the end, situations like that are unpredictable but with Telegram bots we can achieve automatic moderationing when any moderator is online.
Also something important in a moderation it's being polite, understand both situations and try to solve the problem like you will
when you do "decision makings" in your daily software developments.
