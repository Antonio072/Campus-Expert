## Summary of the Community's Needs

As in the community-assesment exercise stated we are from an engineering college, we have a mixed bag of students, some which are very experienced, and other’s who are motivated and are ready to get their hands in the development world.
We try to cater to every student by having workshop’s from basic to advance level, whenever we organize a talk we always try to title if the workshop is a getting started or an advance level. The communication take’s place over Facebook, WhatsApp & by meeting the team personally.

The students here are improving day by day and we aim to support them with talks/materials to make their experience more fruitful & more informative.

## Your Proposal

Already we have started to work on the proposal which aims to


- Gather more people into the world of open source irrespective of their domain.
- Teach them how to successfully gel up with an organization.
- Bag an internship or indulge into programs specifically Google summer of Code & Outreachy.

This way the students not only learn about using Git & GitHub, but also experience

- How to maintain a big project .
- How to collaborate where number of collaborators/members are huge.
- How to code efficiently.

To attain the mentioned goals, we have been & will organize more talks/workshops/tutorials for these topics, and from the previously held workshops the turnout & the feedback of students were pretty amazing.

We like to do a workshop week, like there is 4 days of continuous workshops of 2-3 hours each, all for different topics or maybe same if its going to be long.

So by the current plan, the tentative plan for the next semester is to have

- One right after the semester starts
- One before the 1st unit test's
- One in between the 1st & 2nd unit test's
- And the last after the 2nd unit test's  

The current topics in mind are internships | programs like GSOC, machine learning, image processing, Git & the world of open source etc. 

We don't need any resources as such, as we get the rooms allotted by the college itself which is free of cost and rest the goodies/swags which we distribute is at the minimal cost and we are able to easily fund them.

For communication we used Facebook & WhatsApp to spread the word, and we do have the contact details of the respective speakers on the posters so they can ask any question they want before coming to the workshops.

## Your Proposal's Impact


- Target audience
  - Basically all of the students who are tech enthusiast, and have a feeling of learning/exploring new things
- Community needs
  - To teach students how to be better in their development field.
  - How can one fit/join other organizations smoothly.
- Resources
  - What do we need to do:  
    - Conduct workshop, tutorials, hackathons for the students
    - Spread the material.
    - For conducting bigger hackathons we do need some sponsers for the various needs of the event, we have some but it’s always better if we have more.
    - Collect more swags/cash prizes to giveaway.
- Media
  - We are working on better, more attractive websites that people can go through.
  - Better posters/ interactive posters on website/blog to catch attention of more students
  - Increasing members in our community to have a large number of mouth to mouth publicity.
  - Sending reminders for students on the workshop day.
- Content knowledge
  - I personally am a
    - User of GitHub/Git since three years and have an ample of experience of how to and how to not do things.
    - Selected **Twice** for the Google Summer of Code.
    - Been a mentor in Outreachy & Google Code In.
    - Finalists in hackathons.
    - And a lot of freelancing experience.
- Timeline
  - For the GitHub/Git workshops, we organized one on 14th, 15th of October after the 1st Test’s
  - Another one we are going to have in October.

## Planning for the Future

Our plan for the future is basically to conduct more and more talks/hackathons which we can for the students.

**When will you review the impact of your proposal?**


- After each workshop we take feedback’s from students to make the next workshop much better
- Review the code at every coding competition.

**How will you measure success?**


- By giving a small exercise after each workshop and analyzing how many could complete and if not then why?
- By counting how many students got into Open source programs

**How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?**

After each event we briefly go through the plans and how the next one could be made better.
