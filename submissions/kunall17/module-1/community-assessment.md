- WhatsApp to circulate the announcements.

Both are very actively used, as all the college announcements are also circulated using the mentioned methods.

**Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?**

We currently WhatsApp groups for different clubs.


----------


## Culture

**How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?**

We are tech enthusiasts, so whatever new tech/idea comes under our collar we heartily welcome them. And try to follow up or help them in whatever way we can to make their idea successful.

For new comers we often hold basic/getting started talks so that they can take a step into developing. In fact in the last week (22 Sept) I conducted a talk for Git and using GitHub to start contributing to an open source organization. This talk was scheduled for 6 - 7:30 but the people became so interested in the talk that they didn't mind extending the talk till 8:30 (which is an unusual time for a talk in college) and I was able to cover everything which was scheduled for the other day, fun fact I also gave them an exercise for creating a Pull Request on the test repo we were working and around 70% of them were able to do without needing my help, that's really some good numbers.

**What happens if there is a disagreement?**

We always consider the majority as the agreement, if suppose a person has a debatable opinion we always consider what the majority wants and the decision is what the majority says.

**Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?**

No policies as such, just the talk/workshop should be informative enough.
But we do follow a certain code of conduct:

- Be friendly and patient.
- Be welcoming.
- Be respectful
- No use of abusive words
- No discrimination based on caste, religion, sex.
