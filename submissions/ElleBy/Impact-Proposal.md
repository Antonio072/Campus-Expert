# Impact Proposal



## Summary of the Community's Needs


### Community demographics
The society is almost completely made up of computer science students, mostly between the ages of 18-22. The current size of the community is relatively small and we are planning on trying to double numbers by the end of the academic year.
The resources that the society members have are easily accessible to them, however they are somewhat limited. 

### Communication
DevSoc mainly relies on Slack or Facebook to communicate. This is helpful as it enables instant communication between individual members or the entire group. 

### Culture
The culture within DevSoc isn't particularly diverse. This is mostly because the majority of the students who join are studying the same subject. This isn’t a problem in the respect that it allows students with a similar course to get help from their peers. However, this also means that the society might not seem as friendly to those that just want to join the society, so we lose out on people with different experiences of the tech world and the potential to make the society better.


## Your Proposal
As the summer is nearly over we, as a society, are planning events that will help to encourage the new students to join.
We are currently planning on doing a small presentation at the beginning of term to introduce ourselves and to encourage people to come a join us. We are also planning non-tech related events such as a treasure hunt around the city to encourage students to socialise as well as introducing them to the city they will be spending the next few years in. 
We are, however, going to be losing some members due to placement years and graduation.

As we want to increase the size of the society we have decided to invest more time in encouraging current students to attend, as well as students from degrees that don't relate to computer science. We want everyone to feel welcome, even if they don't have more than a passing interest in the world of computers.
We are planning on being a lot more active on social media, both to advertise the society and in order to encourage active communication between the members of the society. We plan on mostly using Facebook to do this although Slack will also be a key part. 
We also intend on having people from areas of the industry come in a give talks to the students, to show them what their degree or passion can mean in terms of a career and a hobby.


## Your Proposal's Impact

Target audience
New and current students at Nottingham Trent university

Community needs
Lack of active members

Resources
More advertisement, greater social opportunities, pizza
Some of this will need to be obtained through funding, but most of it just requires the society to spend more time socialising and actively recruiting.

How will you obtain those resources?
Media, holding events both tech related and not, advertising across the university through word of mouth and but going into classes.

How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
I am planning on delivering the proposal in person during the first meeting between my fellow committee members, then in a meeting with other members of the society

What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
By speaking to the other members of DevSoc committee in order to get their ideas to add to my own. I will then come up with some ideas for planning socials as well as getting hackathons together. I would also like to make a timetable for members of the society to access so that they can see what tech events are happening in Nottingham.


## Content knowledge

How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?


## Timeline
Within the first week of term one we will have had a society meeting, a small presentation for new students, as well as a few social events so we can meet people and get them talking.


## Planning for the Future
The main way that I can measure the success of the proposal is by judging the numbers of DevSoc members. This won’t be something I can measure quickly as some people might stop attending.
We are planning on having events at least once a term, as well as advertising the society in person once a term. This is in the hope that by reminding people that we are there will encourage them to attend and take part in the society.
