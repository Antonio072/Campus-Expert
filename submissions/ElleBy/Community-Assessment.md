# Community Assessment


## Define

### How would I define my community?
A group of like-minded students from Nottingham Trent studying computer science and similar courses.


## Size

### How many people currently in the community?
Approximately 30 however, this changes every year due to students leaving and new students joining.

### How many would you like to be in your community?
Over 60

### Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change
In the past the society has been larger. The drop in numbers might be for a lot of reasons; the attitude of students, the timetable and workload the students have, a decrease in the number of social activities done by the society, lack of advertisement around the university. 


## Resources

### What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
In Nottingham we are very lucky that we have a very good tech community and a lot of support from companies around us. There are a lot of meet ups around the area which accommodate different tech interests and skill levels.
As a society we tend to take part in Hack24, which is a hackathon that is run by a local tech community every year. There are a few other hackathons that we take place in although they tend to be national or world wide as travelling to other places for hackathons can be difficult.
As students we have a lot of support from our teachers and lecturers and can often go to them for help and extra information. 
As a society we also have weekly meetings and the occasional workshop. We also have a room in which members of the community can meet up and get help from each other or just do their own work.


## Accessibility


### How accessible are the current resources in your community?
The resources in the society are, for the most part, easily available.
However, in order to access the society room you must be a member of the society as the door requires a valid keycard to open. 
We are currently working on changing this to allow the room to be easier to access, such as allowing students from certain courses access by default. Unfortunately, there is only so much we can do as the access isn't restricted by DevSoc but by the university.

### Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
For the most part the meetings are held when people wont be working. However, as student timetables vary some may be unable to attend the meetings. For those that can't attend we keep meeting notes which they can access as well as summarising the meeting on Facebook.


## Interests

### Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
Our society is mostly made up of students studying computer science related topics. This is simply because it is mostly applicable to them.
However, we do not exclude those from other subjects and next year will be actively encouraging students studying other subjects to join. 


## Goal

### Why do people get involved in your community?
One reason that students join the society is simply that it is a good way to get help with coursework from other students.
Students also get involved in order to spend more time developing, as it is something the society tries to encourage in those that are interested.
We also attend meet ups around the city as a group so it's a nice way of encouraging people to go as they may feel less awkward attending with us than on their own.
Next year we plan on getting more involved in the local community, as well as taking more time to participate in hackathons across the country. We hope this is will encourage people to take part as it will give them a break from university and an excuse to travel around meeting like minded people. For the same reason we are also going to spend a lot more time working on the social side of the society within the group.


## Location

### Where does your community currently gather?
Currently our group gathers at the Clifton Campus, in the room that has been given to us. Information is also on the Facebook page and we are currently working on a website.
There is parking for the students, but only is they have a parking permit for the student car park. 
Because the meeting room is on campus there is plenty of transport too and from the city to the campus.
There is no charge to members of the society for the use of the space or membership to the society. Although we tend to use the same room we do have the option of booking other, large rooms, should we need to.
The main DevSoc room can hold about 15 people and contains 10 computers. Most of the time there is water and snacks available.


## Communication

### How does your community get in touch with one another?
There are a few ways for the society to get in touch with each other. The main way is through the Slack group or through Facebook. However, we do have an email address and a twitter account, if that form of communication is easier for the member.
Our organisation would benefit from being more active on these, which is something we are aiming to do and encourage next year.


## Culture

### How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
Our society does as much as possible to be welcoming to new members. We attend give a small presentation to new students at the beginning of the year and actively encourage the members of our societies to engage with the rest of the university and encourage others to join the society.
As of yet I havenâ€™t had to deal with any disagreement within the society. However, there are procedures in place to deal with problems that might arise.
