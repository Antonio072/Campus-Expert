## Summary of the Community's Needs

HackobotsMx promotes hardware and software development and brings robotics to people of all ages and all backgrounds; we are a group of people who want to make positive changes in our country through technological development. 
We are a strong community, with 1076 members and the communication channels with the members seem to be effective.
The communication with the organizers is really good. All of us knows exactly what to do and we love to teach and share what we learn.
All the team members are commited.

#### Our main needs are:

- **A fixed place:** We really need to find a place in which we can do the meetups.
- **A lab:** Having a lab would open the possibility to build more prototypes.
- **Hardware sponsorship:** To lend it to the community in the workshops.
- **Papers participation:** To promote research on robotics.

## Proposal

- **Organization:**
I propose a better organization for the meetups. Preparing them weeks before make them and doing a manual to get familiarized for those who are not into the field.

- **Timing:**
We do the meetups on saturdays so all kind of people can attend them.
Usually we took more time than the time we say is going to take us doing any project so, we need to respect the time we set at the begining, to do this, I propose to convoke more staff to aid people to acomplish their projects.

- **More Staff:**
We can propose the constant attendees to be volunteers to help newbie people.

## Proposal's Impact

* Target Audience: People who is interested in robotics and wants to build, learn and replicate the knowledge acduired. This people can be of all ages and gender.

* Community needs: Providing a space where everyone feels comfortable and free to build projects no matter what they do or study.

* Resources:
  * A space with machines and special tools for makers and hackers.
  * Sponsored kits with protoboards and electronic stuff.
  * Speakers. The five members of the team rotate in order to give a workshop but we could bring more experienced people.

* Media:

  * We should update the repos we use in GitHub to share the projects we've done. Because sometimes we don't maintain it.
  * We shuold create a blog.
  * Broadcast live on facebook.

* Content Knowledge:

  * I'm really good at managing teams, and even better to inspire people (because I love people). Also I am always reading and putting in practice my technical knowledge. I have participated in many hackathons, I've won startup weekend and I even tried to launch my own startup (even thougt it didn't worked) but I learnd also from my mistakes. So, I am opened to new experiences and to do something amazing for Mexico.
  * The other team members also are good on their fields, so we complement each other.

* Timeline:

  * At least 1 workshop per month.
  * The workshops last on average 4 hours, but they can last more (depending the project).
  * Participate in a research project.


## Planning for the future

* We set a deadline in January 2018 to talk about the path of the community and the path we should follow.
* The impact will be measured by the number of people who attend the meetups and by applying an poll to ask what can we improve.
* We set another deadline in June 2018 to participate in a research.
* We would love to bring beautifil experiences for the members so getting a sponsoship is primordial.
