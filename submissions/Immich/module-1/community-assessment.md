### Definition

My community's name is HackobotsMx, in which we promote hardware and software development and bring robotics to people of all ages and all backgrounds; we are a group of people who want to make positive changes in our country through technological development.
We are all (organizers) students from National Polytechnic Institute in different areas such Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Robotics.
Also we love to share what we've learned by ourselves. Everybody is welcome to learn and to propose.

### Size

There are 1076 members registered, but due to variety of robotics topics, not all the members are interested in all of them so on average we have 30 attendees per meetup. Some are constant, others are not.
The meetups we do, take place in the center Mexico City
We expect to expand to other cities and make the community bigger and inclusive.

### Resources

The place we usually do our meetups lends us kits with basic material. We organize a meetup per month and we are trying to organize events in hackathon format.

### Accessibility

We are struggling with having a fixed place to do our meetups, and to get sponsorships to provide kits to attendees.
We would really love to have a hacker space :heart: 

### Interests

As an inclusive community we want to explode all the abilities and interests from the members. So we try to do meetups using and implementing different tools just to learn how to do any project. As said before, everybody is welcome.

### Goals

I think part of the success of hackrobotsMx is in fact the goal to build robots and our own technology. Almost of the members wants to create a solution for education or just to learn something they can not learn in school (because is hard to study robotics in Mexico).
What we've found beautiful and inspiring is how some even if they don't know the people, try to help them.

I am looking forward to sponsorships, that would give us a boost to build more prototypes and inspiring others. Doing some research and growing.
Everybody wants their own robot.

Our biggest goal is to have our own hacker space with specialized material and a lab to build robots and software!

### Location

We do the meetups in TelmexHub, a coworking space with a special room for workshops.
The infraestructure is very good but their logistic is not, due this, we have had problems in our meetups with the requeriments.
There is public transportation available nearby and it's accessible easily but is a little bit insecure around.

### Communication

* Our main channel is [Meetup](meetup.com/es-ES/HackrobotsMX/).
* Also we use [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HackRobotsMX/) to post news and the events.
* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hackrobotsmx/) has not many followers but we use it too.

### Culture

Our culture is based on sharing knowledge. The more knowledge you share, the more knowledge you will receive.
We also want to break the stereotype that "Robotics is for men" so, we encourage to kids, women and old people to get involve in robotics if they are interested and not to be afraid of participate with other people younger or more experienced. We all have been noobs anytime.
And above all, build something to help others or to solve any social problem.
