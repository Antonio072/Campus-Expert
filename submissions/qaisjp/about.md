I'm a programmer, currently working towards a BEng Computer Science degree at The University of Edinburgh.

GitHub Campus Training is a pretty cool thing, and everything it offers is pretty useful, so that's why I am here.

I have [a website](https://qaisjp.com) that mentions some of the stuff I do, it also has a blog I neglect.

I'm also President at The University's of Edinburgh's Computing and AI Society, [CompSoc Edinburgh](http://comp-soc.com). We use GitHub
[quite a bit](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh).
