## Assessing CompSoc's Needs

### Definition
- How would you define your community?

It's almost entirely students studying an undergraduate degree in The School of Informatics at The University of Edinburgh. It's aimed towards anyone interested in tech, but we don't get many non-Informatics students.

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?

Around 350 are currently in the community, and I'm personally an advocate for "the more the merrier". I just want to have a great time with everyone!

- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?

No, not really. The numbers usually go up because our university takes more students each year.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?

We run Student Tech Meetups (STMUs) every third Wednesday of the month during term time, run the annual [Hack the Burgh](http://hacktheburgh.com), and do plenty of other talks and workshops throughout the year.

Our members also run [special interest groups](http://comp-soc.com/special-interest-groups), and we have groups currently focusing on:
- Web development (SIG: Web)
- Cyber Security ([SIGINT](http://sigint.mx))
- and soon: Networking

I think this is pretty good, but ideally we could do some more work on teaching basic programming, for non Informatics students...

This past year I have also been running [Better Informatics](https://betterinformatics.com), which is now being put under the CompSoc wing.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
- Is there childcare available?

All our resources are on [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh), linked to on [our website](http://comp-soc.com) as well as the Better Informatics website linked above.

Unfortunately, it seems that people find it harder to contribute when they must create a GitHub account, so now we're going to add in-site editing for Better Informatics. This will ideally be powered by Gollum, which is the exact same thing that powers GitHub's wikis.

Meetings are held generally outside working hours (around 7pm), so it should not be too much of an issue. We only have our venue till 9pm — so this year we might start from 6:30 if we have to.

Childcare is not available, and we welcome volunteers that are interested in helping to make this a thing.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?

It is made primarily of Computer Science students, and as mentioned above, we really want other people to get involved in our society. We're working towards collaboration with other societies.

Our community covers the wide range of Informatics, but we have subcommittees (SIGs) working on producing excellent content in a more specific context.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?

Well...

A lot of our members are either:

- just working towards a computer science degree
- looking to gain some awesome experience
- have a genuine interest in tech _in general_
- are looking for job opportunities!

We keep a lot of our content open source, so we encourage our members to contribute to our open source projects (Better Informatics, SIG:Web, etc). I hope for CompSoc's members to become more of a closer knit community, rather than just a bunch of people that show up to talks and workshops _sometimes_.


### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

We gather in the Informatics Forum — the research building for The School of Informatics. We also shamelessly hijack Appleton Tower for our own events. The room we use for our events allows for up to 100 people, and we get pizza ready for people to devour outside the room in between talks.

We've used our talk room and the pizza room two times so far as the venue for Hack the Burgh, I'd say it's pretty flexible. Unfortunately, we can't always book the bigger "room" (ahem, it's an atrium!). In general venue is pretty well accessible—no stairs are require to enter.

There is parking available nearby, and the price depends on how far you'd like to walk. We're situated in a university building, so we're on campus, and there is university parking (for those that pay for it) and amazing public transport links (we're in the middle of the city).

Fizzy drinks are of course provided alongside the pizza.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

Well, we figured out we have a LOT of stuff. So we created [a page](comp-soc.com/community) for it. This website is brand new, and is currently in the cold-launch state.

We do have newsletters and a [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh) though.

Discord has proven to be useful to a certain demographic of users. Unfortunately, we can't please everybody, and the IRC community is thriving.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
- How will you personally handle it?

We welcome everyone, and we love to have new people with new ideas! We are also working towards including procedures to follow in [our constitution](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/constitution), but the general idea has been that we hold a committee meeding and formally agree on a solution.
