## Needs, Proposal, and Impact
I think it would be a good idea to add a forum to Better Informatics, this would allow for some long term discussion that might not suit a relatively quick moving Facebook group. This forum would be strongly academic, but allow for other topics as well. Since we are also strongly affiliated with [The Tardis Project](https://tardis.ed.ac.uk), the forum would be a good place for members there to get involved, too.

This would involve setting up a couple virtual machines on The Tardis Project, and putting the whole thing behind an optional Cosign authentication (weblogin) (as well as Tardis LDAP for those involved with Tardis). This is a big project, and will take quite a bit of time.

I know of a few people that use Slack, but most certainly don't use Discord. We have a Discord to IRC bridge, and we need to work on the Slack to IRC bridge too.

I'm already writing a new [Discord to IRC bridge](https://github.com/qaisjp/go-discord-irc) to facilitate better links between Discord and IRC, and there are many Slack to IRC bridges that currently exist. We have the servers, we just need someone to run this.

Not all our members come to our student tech meetups (it's impossible for them to right now, I guess, our venue simply doesn't fit that many people!), and ideally we would up that number. Perhaps those people that don't come to STMUs actually do take part in other events, or perhaps they are just here for the socials. That's fine, but we need to make sure that we satiate everyone's needs.

We are hoping to establish a new special interest group: SIGTeach, aimed at teaching basic programming skills. This should be favourable to non Informatics students.

For everything, we intend to advertise heavily on our Facebook Groups and of course our monthly STMUs. I may even do a talk about Better Informatics' development and history.

In the end, we have pizza, and that's the big thing that brings people to our STMUs. We're a society that does a lot of workshops and talks, but we attract members and their friends because we have pizza. More people mean more pizza pizza pizza. :pizza:

### Timeline
- Work on building SIGTeach team
- Better Informatics development
- Ensure both the irc and non-irc communities are not alienated by bridging chat well
- Add forum for discussion
- (start of term)
- Community be involved on chat (by contacting tutors and updating official university media)
- Advertise [student talks](https://github.com/campus-experts/open-training/pull/37#discussion_r132009136)
- (end of year)
- Better Informatics is used frequently, and an integral part of the community

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
- How will you measure success?
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?

I'll be involved with this society until fourth year, probably, so I'll probably be atleast maintaining Better Informatics. Better Informatics is a popular tool within The School of Informatics.

Success here spans multiple years and involves outreach with the future years â€” it's much more difficult to change what people are currently used to. My focus right now is to influence what the new cohort does and give them a great community. This will ideally propagate down and improve the sense of community at CompSoc and in the School of Informatics.

Better Informatics being put under the CompSoc wing gives it a future supported by the society handover process. The project isn't being built by the society committee, however, so we can ensure it (and everything in this proposal) ages smoothly across more than just the next academic year.

I'll be reviewing the impact of my proposal each month to see how it has progressed, to see if it has been making a difference, and whether certain things are being used (if relevent at that moment).
