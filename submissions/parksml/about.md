## Where & Who
I am currently a computer science major at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. Fall of 2017 marks the start of my sophomore year. Last semester I was involved with three VCU clubs: RamDev (software development), LUG: Linux Users Group, and Cyber Security. Schedule permitting, next semester I would like to be involved in the clubs already listed and the AMC club that only meets during the fall.

After organizing a student led trip to Bitcamp in spring of 2017, RamDev made me the ‚ÄúHackathon Czar‚Äù officer and I am currently helping to plan RamHacks 2017!

## Code
I am a Python man by heart, Java student by schooling, and a begrudging self-learning C/C++ apprentice. My favorite topic to code in is networking. Web sockets, Bluetooth, NFC, it‚Äôs all magic to me. 

Editor of choice: Atom from GitHub

Language of choice: python3

Operating System of choice: Ubuntu Mate

## Free Time
When I‚Äôm not coding or learning something related to software, I‚Äôm finding some way to be a nerd. I watch a lot of Netflix and play a lot of video games. Overwatch, Terraria, Fallout, and lots of others. I might be the biggest Fallout franchise fan you‚Äôll ever know. Nowadays I mostly pay the three listed above along with some niche games that I only play with my close high school friends like PUBG. If you run into "Dad76" in an Overwatch match, say hi!
