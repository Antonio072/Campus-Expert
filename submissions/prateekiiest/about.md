# About Me

Hi there, I am **Prateek Chanda from India**. I am currently an undergrad in Indian Institute of Engineering Science & Technology, Shibpur and am 
pursuing Computer Science as my majors.

I am currently the Open Source Head and Project Head of my college coding club [codeIIEST](https://codeiiest.github.io/) and have been working
with the club promoting open source culture in the campus and mentoring students for open source internships.

Being a memeber of GDG kolkata (Google Developers Group) and having volunteered as a teacher in Code.org for the past 4 months, I aim to work 
in terms of education for the underpriviledged groups of my country with the help of my **codeIIESTians**.



# Interests

* I love contributing to open source softwares - I have been working with [SunPy](http://sunpy.org/) which is a solar physics software aiming
to use python modules to examine solar flares and electron flux of the Sun from SDO , NASA observatory.
And the open source contribution list continues ;)

* Love biking and camping.

* Die-hard Sherlock fan.

* Lastly I do love to write. Whenever I get time, I would pen down my thoughts on a blog to share it to the world.
