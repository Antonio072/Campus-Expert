# Community Impact Proposal

After talking with the students and having short classes with them, I reached to the conclusion that students here need a good project experience to work upon apart from their academic work.

The relevant stages where the students want more improvement are :
* Algorithm Design
* Working on Open Source projects.
* Understanding on different frameworks 
* Building Cool Websites, web apps.
* Software testing.
* Leadership Skills
* Public Speaking

--------------------------------------------
## Community Demographics

* Size : More than 100 people. People from any stream are invited to the club. Team consists of around 8 members. 

* Age: 19 - 24

* Resources
  - People : Only a few students are there who really knows about Open Source.
  - Github Organization: Our main platform it allows us to achieve our goals.

## Communication.
We do it via our facebook page or whatsapp or github issues.

## Culture
The coding culture is quite in its initial stage and we hope to reach out to the maximum people as possible. Anyone who wants to learn and share are welcome to the community.

--------------------------------------------------------------


## Proposal
What we're looking for in the first month of the project is to engage more people in open source projects. We start with simple algorithm projects where newcomers will contribute. And as little by little they gain experience we look forward to work on a large-scale project (we have the idea ready) and make it to a successful start-up.

### Timing
| Week |              Title              |                                                    Description                                                    |           Status            |
|:----:|:-------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|   3  | Introducing students to Git and Github | Learn about version control and git workflow. |    :white_square_button:    |
|   4  |    Building algorithm repositories for contribution | Students can start contributing to such projects. We came up with a bounty based open source competition for this where students with more valid contributions get more points.    |    :white_square_button:    |
|   5  | Generate event calendar        | Publish an event calendar on the organization that includes on campus events and off campus events as well.        |    :white_square_button:    |
|   6  | Discuss about building real life applications      | Introducing students about frameworks , web apps and how to make one.  |    :white_square_button:    |

### Community Demographics
For these first steps will be focusing on every stream keeping into account to take extra time for the non-CS students.

### Goals
  - Github Expert , contributing to open source projects like a pro.
  - Building something useful for the campus.
  - Creating a campus buzzword for our club and reaching out to the maximum people possible.

### Communication

We are currently having a slack channel for all the important project discussions. We also have a group on whatsapp where we update the upcoming timings.

## Proposal's Impact

In this section, analyze your community's needs against what your proposal aims to accomplish. Itemize each of the needs you hope to address with your proposal and indicate whether each of these needs are within the scope of your proposal.
When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
* Target audience
   - Any stream of engineering with a love for coding
   - Community needs
   - Building a Structure for the Community.
   - A Detailed Knowledge on Open Source. 
   - Develop Real Life Applications.

* Resources
   - We have limited resources except we have people from the Facebook Developers Group and Google Developers Group to guide us.

* Media
  - Through FB page.

* Content knowledge
  - The campus is well connected with the industry and we as students know people from different developer communities.

-----------------------------------------------

## Planning for the Future

* When will you review the impact of your proposal?
   - After completing week 5, I will review it.
* How will you measure success?
   - By the conversations that take place on the Organization, the number of attendees, amount of new repos and project contributions in the github organization and the experience gained by the students.

* How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
   - After Every 2 months.
