## Assessing My Community's Needs
   


### Definition

Founded in Nov 2014 the coding community called codeIIEST, one of the **geekiest** club of the campus started with a bunch of students to 
promote competitive coding and open source culture inside the campus.

After 3 years of its journey, it has gathered many people under its hood. Apart from organising occasional workshops, the club has mentored students
for competitions like Gsoc and ACM ICPC with people from the club bragging those prestigious positions. The team consists of people mainly from the 
Computer Science Department of the college -  Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology Shibpur.

The club has four chapters currently, namely
* Competitive Coding Chapter
* Open Source Chapter
* Security Chapter
* Machine Learning Chapter


### Size
The current club consists of around 10 students from the pre-final years and around 8 from the sophomore years. Along with that there are alumni
and few final year students who are a part of the core team.

### Resources

 * To be very honest, resources are limited , but we are trying our hearts out to make the club on of the best of its kind in the country. Apart from codesheets we update students on a weekly basis through tutorials on docs, or slides.
 
 * We have regular meetups, sometimes on a weekly basis where we organise classes for the freshman and sophomores. 
 
 * We did not have hackathons due to limited resources, but we trying to do that this year.
 
 * There are no specific hours. We are always active online for anyone needing guidance.
 
 
 ### Accessibility 
 
 * The meerings are held every month, infact during the weeks, except before the semesters.
 * They are held after classes during the evening, taking into account everyone's opinion about the timings.
 * Apart from that we have a Slack chat room where people post their doubts or need some tutorials.

### Interests

Mainly coding and geeky stuffs, but everyone is welcome here. Anyone having a curiosity or love for coding, our doors are always open for them.


### Goals

* To get proper guidance and mentorship about the subject.
* To get internship opportunites and even job opportunites.
