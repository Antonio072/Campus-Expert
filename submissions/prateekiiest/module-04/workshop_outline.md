# Open Source Research Workshop Outline

This is a plan for a 90 minute workshop that introduces Research in Open Source.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Task

### Learning Goals
* Understand what open source is and which major organisations are using it
* Understand Git and version control
* Brief Introduction to Github
* Creating your first repository
* How to create Pull Requests and Issues
* Importance of Issues, Branches and how to create one.
* Understanding community work and good practices about Open Source.
* Understanding how research work can be done on github and how people from different research community can contribute to a project on a single platform
* A brief undersranding of the technologies used in research work mainly in  Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
* An outline on how students can contribute to research organisations on Github and even host their own work on Github as a part of their final year thesis or university funded project.

------------------------------------------------------------------

### Demonstrations and examples

* Installing Git on their laptops and testing the different commands
* Setting up github account and creating your first repository
* Contribute small codes to a research based open source project and gain knowledge on
how to fork and clone the repo and commit your changes.
* Implement some of the technologies involved in research work, notably tensorflow , scipy. 

-------------------------------------------------------

### Target Audience

Students from all years are welcome to attend this event. Even students from outside the college are welcome to attend this event.

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Discussions and pairing opportunities

Open Source is all about team work and sharing common ideas. And when it is a research project like shipping a software/ or a research package it is more of a team work than individual. So having participants exchange and review code, or work together on code in pairs, is an easy and valuable way to promote collaboration.

------------------------------------------ 

### Learner Participation

Questions to ask learners to create an engaging discussion

* Why do you think we need a version control system?  Where have you seen it used?
* What is open source?
* How can we do research work or a project that can be open sourced ?
* How you can create your first small research project and open source it ?

-----------------------------------------------

### Recovery points
* Give time for people to download Git
* Address commom issues among the learners
* A team of 4-5 people will be assigned with a helper for addressing their issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Adapting to your participants

* Some participants may know concepts before while some may not be so comfortable with using Git and command line. So we need to deal separately for that. We plan to assign a few members for an advanced course to the people already knowing about it and the basic course for people who are new to it.

* Ask the learners about the pace of the workshop after completing each course item. Use this and the opinions of the helpers to judge the pace of the workshop. We can even backtrack our concepts for slow learners.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What happens after?

* Provide them with other resources for learning git.
* Since we as a club have learning resources, we can provide them with it. 
* Email them a copy of the git cheat sheet
* A copy of the research based projects on Github
* Resources for learning Tensorflow and other resources for research based work.
* A handout of the research organisations on Github and how a newbie can start contribute to them.

For any doubts and clarifications learners can always ask us on the slack channel or through our Facebook page.
