# Definition of the Community

I would define the community as the union of members of the club CodeNetwork, and students of QUT.

# Size

Whilst CodeNetwork has > 3500 members at time of writing, and is based from QUT, the number of actual QUT students who are members of the club is probably closer to 150. Most of the members have either graduated recently, or are students of other nearby universities.

I would like new students, especially first years to join the club to ensure continuation of collaboration each year.

The club has been growing steadily, going from 1000 to 3500 members in a year and a half.

# Resources

Currently, weekly meetups are held where industry speakers are invited in to give talks about the work they do in the real world. Hackathons are also held, and discounted tickets to external hackathons are offered to students.

On top of this, online collaboration pages such as a FaceBook Group are available.

# Accessibility

Currently everything is very accessible. Online resources and information about events are available to anyone with a FaceBook account.

Meetings are held on Friday's after 6PM, to ensure no one is working, and hackathons are held on weekends.

Childcare is not offered by the club, however the University has childcare facilities.

# Interests

The community is mostly Computer Science students, however there are definitely members of other disciplines. There are many Information Systems students, Design students, and Electrical Engineering students who are members of the club. Most of these people aren't necessarily studying Computer Science, but have an interest in something related to it.

We're very open to any topic that is in some form 'code' related. This includes web design, cryptography, etc.

# Goals

People get involved to learn more about the industry, and meet like-minded people. Out of the students in the club, they're definitely hoping to get a degree. The main reason people attend is to learn about what employers look for, and to get connections.

Most of the people who attend are definitely passionate about software development.

A goal that I feel would be good is to encourage more social activities to strengthen the community outside of a code setting, and to also start up workshops during the Uni week to help students on whatever they're struggling with.

# Location

Currently the community gathers at QUT (Queensland University of Technology) in whichever room is available that fits our needs. Parking is not free, as it's in the middle of Brisbane city, however it's usually fairly easy to get a park at the time of the events.

Public transport is very abundant due to the location, so most members choose to use that over cars. Due to this as well, it's very easy for non-students to attend the events.

The space is free, so we don't charge anything for membership or to attend the events. We use FaceBook's events feature to get a rough idea on attendance, and book rooms based on that. This way we can accomodate any reasonable amount of people.

The seating is normal university lecture seats, and we provide pizza to everyone who attends.

# Communication

The community communicates using a FaceBook group. We plan on creating a Discord chat room to facilitate more casual faster communication.

# Culture

We greatly welcome new people and ideas as long as they aren't trying to gain free labour. 

If there are disagreements they're discussed by the executive committee, who are elected at the start of the year.

We have a constitution, however it's not published anywhere yet due to University requirements.

I solve disputes by trying to find the most peaceful solution amongst both parties, ensuring both continue to feel a part of the community unless not possible.
