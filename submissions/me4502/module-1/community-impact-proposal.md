# Summary of the Community's Needs

The community is of around ~150 people, of varying education levels (Undergraduate, post-graduate, etc). There are definite gender and race disparities, with a majority of members being either white or asian males.

All resources are widely available to the community, as they are public spaces for collaboration such as a FaceBook group.

Communication is primarily conducted through the FaceBook group, or over a fairly new Discord guild. As the discord guild is very new, most communication is still done over the FaceBook group.

The current culture within the group is fairly casual. Everyone's very friendly and open to new ideas and to help beginners. When people are negative towards new programmers we try to make sure they change their behaviour on our pages and at our events.

# The Proposal

Starting in 2018, the proposal is to start running more events. One on Tuesday's, and one on Friday's. 

The friday events will be targetted to the general audience, and be industry speaker events. On Tuesday's, the events will be mostly focused on teaching newer programmers about topics that aren't covered too well in university classes. The main of which is git, as it's very poorly taught in the university curriculum.

The aim with the tuesday events are to encourage more newer programmers to feel included, and to be feel less intimidated about being a part of the club. I've heard many students say they don't feel they can participate as well because they have just started programming and are too intimidated.

As well as this, monthly optional social events on Saturday's, such as a "Code in the Park" with a barbecue event could further bridge the social gap between more advanced and beginner programmers in the club, making everyone feel more comfortable and welcome.

Work also should be put into having collaborative events with other groups around the university, such as Women in Tech, to increase diversity within the club.

The Discord guild should also be continued, and further expanded based on the feedback of the community.

# The Impact

The target audience is mostly new programmers, to ensure continued growth of the club. This is addressing the need of continued expansion and replacement of members as they graduate.

The proposal should help work towards the needs of further diversity, and inclusivity for members. If newer programmers feel more welcome, they'll be more included in the event and strive to push themselves to the best of their abilities.

The main resource required to accomplish this is time. Room bookings, and other basic event requirements are not really an issue, however the time required to organise the events is. A larger team organising the events would be a major requirement.

For delivery, it's something we'd advertise on a per-event basis. This would be done via normal methods of FaceBook Events.

I'm fairly knowledgeable on the topic, as I've been organising events for the club all year, and was a member for a year before that. I can further my knowledge by discussing with other clubs, and gaining new ideas as well as collaboration opportunities.

The timeline for this should be the introduction of new event types at the start of 2018, however collaboration would be more of something that slowly happens over the span of the year.

# Future Plans

The impact of the proposal will be reviewed at the end of 2018, to assess how it has gone. Currently we are fairly easily able to notice that we don't have as many first year students in the club as we did last year. Our success criteria is to have had significant growth (> 200%) in first year students becoming engaged in the club by the end of next year. Due to the level of change this year, this isn't too infeasible of a number.

Iterations will be done as needed, however it will be revisited at the mid-year mark, so that any required changes can be implemented for the following semester.
