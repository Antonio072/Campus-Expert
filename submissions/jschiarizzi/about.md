# About Joseph

Hello! My name is Joseph Schiarizzi.  I'm studying computer science at The George Washington University, in Washington DC.  I founded the AR education company [Fourth Wave](fourthwavestudios.com) and the MLH hackathon [Hackital](hackital.io).  I'm from Boston, MA.  I love programming and solving challenges! Invite me to your hackathons!


## Interests

In terms of technology I think AR stuff is very cool.  I like to build things from scratch with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi's.  

I also love hiking and being in the woods.  Last summer I hiked 500 miles on the Appalachian Trail and after I graduate from college I plan to hike the entire trail from Georgia to Maine.  The woods are alive, man!

I love cartography and making [maps](josephschiarizzi.com/Virginia-dems-election-map-2017/) is something I'm really passionate about too.
