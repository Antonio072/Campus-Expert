## Summary of the Community's Needs

CS and tech students at GW need:
The following pieces might help strengthen this section:
- **Community demographics**: There are [TODO size of gw engineering school] students in technical tracks at GW.  We should be able to provide academic, personal, and recreational support to everyone.
- **Communication**: News letter suffer from very low open rates. It's hard to get people to prioritize events we think are important over their already busy lives.
- **Culture**: There are many techies at GW interested in exploring what they can build and learning from each other.

## My Proposal
Provide more support for students who want to and build on existing & learn new tech skills, so they have more time and motivation to pursue and share projects outside of class.

I ran an intro to Git workshop last year and was able to convince a software engineering class professor to offer a small amount of extra credit to students who participated.  This was the first time we had done something like that and it was our most well attended event of the year, besides [Hackital](hackital.io).  

**Timing**: Spring semesters tend to be easier coursework for CS students so we will have more events then.  We already had a 'coffee with your professors' social event where we got the faculty to let freshman out of class a few minutes early in order to meet and greet all the department professors and welcome them to school. Next we will focus on basic intro workshops and encourage techie students to pursue topics they are interested in.

**Goal**: The goal for this year is to have at least 6 similarly attended workshops that are sanctioned by a department as an essential to attend/learn topic.

**Community demographics**: [TODO]

## My Proposal's Impact
By working directly with faculty we provide more incentives to students to learn fundamental skills they need to succeed which aren't covered in class, like Git and scripting languages.

Between now and November 11th we will have fundamental intro workshops and encourage everyone to learn something new.
We will drive encourage students to attend our hackathon on November 11th and 12th.
Through the rest of the year we will support those pursuing outside of class projects with what ever resources they need.

## Planning the future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
At the beginning and end of each semester.

- How will you measure success?
By the number of students engaged and the reflection of the SEAS faculty.

- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
Every other week leaders will discuss progress and future plans, and consider what has been working and what could be done differently.
