# Assessing GW CS community

## Definition
    * Our community is defined as undergraduate students interested in developing technical computer science skills outside the classroom.

## Size
    * Actual: there are ~45 students that make up the population at most of the events.
    * Goal: 150 people, enough to sustain a large hackathon at our school.
    * The CS department at GW has doubled in size twice over the last 2 years, and more students outside the engineering school are learning to value having some _mad technical skillz_.  Since I was a freshman our community has grown from ~10 students.

## Resources
    * The GW ACM maintains a list of online and real books that we recommend.
    * GW IT offers free Lynda.com membership to everyone at the school.  
    * GW Data club and GW ACM alternate on providing intro to python workshops every month, for non tech majors.
    * [Hackital](hackital.io), a hackathon in the Capital.
