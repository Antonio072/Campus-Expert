# Assessing GW CS community

## Definition
* Our community is defined as undergraduate students interested in developing technical computer science skills outside the classroom.

## Size
* Actual: there are ~45 students that make up the population at most of the events.
* Goal: 150 people, enough to sustain a large hackathon at our school.
* The CS department at GW has doubled in size twice over the last 2 years, and more students outside the engineering school are learning to value having some _mad technical skillz_.  Since I was a freshman our community has grown from ~10 students.

## Resources
* The GW ACM maintains a list of online and real books that we recommend.
* GW IT offers free Lynda.com membership to everyone at the school.  
* GW Data club and GW ACM alternate on providing intro to python workshops every month, for non tech majors.
* [Hackital](hackital.io), a hackathon in the Capital.

## Accessibility
* Everyone can access all of the resources, but they probably don't know about the extent to which high quality learning content is there.
* Meetings are in the evenings during the week.
* No child care, but it's also marketed to college students.

## Interests
* Our community is mostly CS students, but also includes some smaller clubs of   other engineering major students.
* The only events that get students from outside CS are intro python/R/HTML workshops. It's hard to get people from outside engineering to other events that don't even require a tech background, like demo days, intro to soldering, blinky light with arduino workshops, etc..
* We try to be open to everyone, but the majority of the time that a business major, or someone outside our initial community comes to a meeting, it is just to pitch an app idea and try to find an engineer.  I think this is a real pain point for a lot of people in our community and a problem with the culture in the greater GW community that we are trying to fight.

## Goals
* People get involved when we make them understand how valuable it is to learn tech skills that aren't being taught in the classroom.  Or when they know that they have fun learning how to build things themselves.
* As a community, we should encourage more people to try new things, and go for learning the basics or a new skill.  We can have a goal of taking more beginners to the next step, and having a higher retention of students that come to a single intro event.

## Location
* We gather in Tompkins Hall, room m06. It's a student run incubator that I helped open.  We can use it any time, have set a side a good portion of it for just team meetings and working on things together. There's water and snacks and a 60 person capacity for single events.
* [Hackital](hackital.io) is in the Marvin Center with a capacity of 750! Wowzers!

## Communication
* We have a facebook group, and a few different slack teams for the groups involved, and news letters. We cross-promote everything and spam people with too many event emails.
* We put up posters in the engineering buildings.

## Culture
* We try to be welcome to everyone.  I think that it is intimidating to people outside engineering to come to an event at a club that is run by all engineers.  Maybe we can do better.
* Finding a mix of _discouraging_ non-tech major students from coming to our meetings looking for someone to build their app for them, while also _encouraging_ non-tech major students to come and learn things.  We want to make tech not seem like magic and not be so scary to learn about! I think this is something that our culture has struggled with.
* We have a constitution to help us choose leaders, define our goals, and settle disputes! No taxation without representation! (Unless you live in Washington DC)
