Hey there, 

my name is Franzwagner, I'm 21 years old, currently living in Brazil. I'm a Computer Science student at [Universidade Federal de Goi√°s](http://www.international.ufg.br/). Learning and loving Shell Script, I recently found out that Windows is good just for games :laughing:

# What community I'm involved with
Right now, I'm involved a lot with [Docker](https://www.docker.com). I'm one of the organisers of [Docker Goiania](https://www.meetup.com/Docker-Goiania) Meetup group and I'm also a Docker Campus Ambassador.

# What's my favourite emoji
My favourite emoji is the :tada: because every commit I make is something new I'm learning and/or doing and should be celebrated.
