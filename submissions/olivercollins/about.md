# About Oliver

Hi, guys! My name is Oliver and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I've been a highly active
hackathon participant as well as the organizer. Hopefully, by the time I graduate college, I will have been to over 50+ hackathons!

## Interests

Besides organizing and organizing and attending hackathons, I usually spend my free time traveling as much as I can and mastering
a ton of different sports!

## Contacting Oliver
