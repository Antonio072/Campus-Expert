Hello!

I am Akasha.

# What I study

I study Computer Science at the University of Mauritius. I currently focus on web and mobile development. I like to learn about anything.

# What communities I am involved with

I am involved in the [Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/MauritiusSoftwareCraftsmanshipCommunity), the [Front-End Dev Mauritius](https://www.facebook.com/frontenddevmauritius), the [Mauritius Maker Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mauritiusmakers) and the [Microsoft Student Partners Mauritius](https://www.facebook.com/MSPartnersMauritius). I regularly attend the Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community's weekly meetups Code & Coffee and their monthly meetups where there are sessions on particular topics. I also attend the meetups of other communities in Mauritius when they occur.

# What I did

I participated in a number of hackathons in Mauritius: [Krakathon](http://krakathon.com) 2016, [#RiSk[Solutions] Mauritius](https://www.facebook.com/RisksMu) 2017 and [WebCup Mauritius](https://www.facebook.com/WebCupMaurice) 2017 (and I will participate in the upcoming Krakathon 2017 and the [Startup Weekend Mauritius](https://www.facebook.com/StartupWeekendMUR) 2017). I also participated in the incubator program of the [MIT Global Startup Labs Mauritius](http://www.telecomcampus.mu/mit-gsl-programme) 2017.

I talked at the [Developers Conference](https://conference.mscc.mu) 2017 about simple 2D game development using JavaScript and Phaser.

I am in the organising team of Front-End Dev Mauritius and help as a coach during their events. We organised the [Front-End Code Camp](https://frontendcodecamp.com) and we are organising a bigger one soon. 

I have one year of experience as a Salesforce developer/consultant intern at Spoon Consulting.

# Why I joined the GitHub Campus Expert training

I am passionate about the tech community. I actively participate in the tech community in Mauritius and I learn a lot from that. Most IT students in Mauritius do not know about the local tech community and I help to promote it because they are missing out on a lot. Becoming a GitHub Campus Expert will help me in the goal of growing the tech community, especially among students.
