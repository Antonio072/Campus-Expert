# About Me
Hi, I'm Joseph, Computer Science student of Cross River University of Technology, Nigeria. Im a Web developer, UI/UX designer also most importantly a critical thinker, I spend most of my time in front of my laptop combining symbols with words, in turn creating awesomeness. When am not punching my laptop, I make new friends, watch movies, read books, or go on long walks with headphones on. I think thats all to me.
