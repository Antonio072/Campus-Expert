Hi all!

I'm Charles Ma, a sophomore at Boston University studying Finance and Computer Science. I'm currently an organizer at BostonHacks,
BU's annual hackathon, as well as e-board of BU Machine Intelligence Community, a group dedicated to unearthing the intricacies of research
and application of machine learning.

In my free time, I like to fence (sabre!), play basketball, play piano, or recreationally weight lift. I'm super excited to be a part of 
the GitHub Campus Experts community, and can't wait to meet everyone!

Charles
