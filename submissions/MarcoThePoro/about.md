# About Marc

Hi I'm Marc Porciuncula, and I'm a first year Software Engineering and Computer Science student at Monash University, in Melbourne, Australia.

### Why GitHub Campus Experts?

I've been coding for a few years, but just recently discovered how big and awesome the coding community is here in Melbourne, and want to help recreate that at my university.

I hope to make it onto the committee of Wired Monash, (Monash's IT student society) and use what I learn in GitHub Campus Expert training to help build out Monash's student developer community.

### Projects

Right now I'm super into JavaScript and the web, I eat new JS frameworks or breakfast!

I particularly like
- React + Redux
- Vue
- GraphQL
- Node

- Functionalish JavaScript with Ramda
- The Material Design spec
