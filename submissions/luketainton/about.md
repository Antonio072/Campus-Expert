# Hello, I'm Luke.

My name is Luke, and I'm a second year Computer Networks student at Birmingham City University. When I'm not making a virtual network
in Packet Tracer or breaking my home network trying to implement a feature that I'm still not sure about, I'll probably be behind
my keyboard implementing a fix on the website for [@HaCSBCU](https://hacs.tech).

I'll be honest, before I came to university I had no coding experience. I'd worked seasonally as an IT Support Engineer at
Zodiac Aerospace for a year and my mind was completely focussed on hardware. Even my degree programme is primarily focussed on
hardware configuration. It was [Pandelis](https://github.com/PandelisZ) and the rest of the HaCS 2016 committee that got me 
into coding. My first hackathon was HackTheMidlands in September 2016.

I work for Asda so very rarely get time off, but when I do, I like attending hackathons and HaCS events.
