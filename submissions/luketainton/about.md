# Hello, I'm Luke.

My name is Luke, and I'm a second year Computer Networks student at Birmingham City University. When I'm not making a virtual network in Packet Tracer or breaking my home network trying to implement a feature that I'm still not sure about, I'll probably be behind my keyboard implementing a fix on the website for [@HaCSBCU](https://hacs.tech).

I'll be honest, before I came to university I had no coding experience. I'd worked seasonally as an IT Support Engineer at
Zodiac Aerospace for a year and my mind was completely focussed on hardware. Even my degree programme is primarily focussed on
hardware configuration. It was [Pandelis](https://github.com/PandelisZ) and the rest of the HaCS 2016 committee that got me 
into coding. My first hackathon was HackTheMidlands in September 2016.

I'm currently helping the 2017 committee with some of the technical development for the society. This includes the website, BullHacks 2.0, and a new project that we're calling SocietyManager.

I work for Asda so very rarely get time off, but when I do, I like attending hackathons and HaCS events. I especially enjoy being around like-minded individuals who share a common sense of belonging - I found it hard to fit in during high school and college so coming to university and meeting all of you has had a huge effect on my self-esteem and how I think of myself.

Thanks for all that you do, and I look forward to meeting you all (again) soon.
