### Definition:
- Now: Women in CS at Tufts
- Want: All non-men who are comfortable in femme spaces in CS at Tufts

### Size:
- We have about 70 interested, but fewer than that are really active and come to things. Part of the problem might be that the “things” we have aren’t what they’re interested in.
- We’re not really striving for a certain size, we just want to have a space where people feel comfortable. Getting all 70-ish of those people involved async at least maybe 2-3 times per semester would be great.
- Historically the group has not existed. We just really formed last year!

### Resources: 
- We have a strong department of classes, but we absolutely don’t have a lot of meet ups and workshops. That’s a thing I’d love to have more of. 
- We have 2 major hackathons ([Polyhack](polyhack.tufts.io) and [ID Hack](https://idhack16.devpost.com/)) and are, this year, holding our first tech conference.

### Accessibility: 
- In terms of physical accessibility, they are accessible for people with movement impairments, except that the computer science building is kind of across campus from some places. We could work on that, maybe hold workshops in different places.
- Meetings *are* sometimes held when people may be working or in class. We can’t really avoid that, but we can vary our meeting times more.
- We do not have childcare, but that’s a resource that Tufts as a whole just does not have. I don’t know of any parents in our community. We could, however, address this by varying our meeting times too.

### Interests:
- Our community is made up of people who are, at least, computer science/design/human factors engineering students. That said, almost all of us are double-majoring and have other interests, and it’s great to keep that in mind. I think we are ok with that, because there are other groups for women engineers in general.
- We’re SUPER open to other topics, but we are focused on a tech flavor, at least.

### Goals:
- People get involved in our community because they are undergraduate femme students seeking community with other femme students in CS. Typically people stay with us because we’re refreshingly different than other CS spaces on campus, in that we’re femme-oriented, don’t focus solely on CS, and are mostly new to programming.
- They are students trying to get a degree, but our community is focused more on trying to get people in internships and eventually full time jobs.
- They are passionate about developing, but I think it’s key that this is not their only interest, and that’s part of our group identity. We talk sometimes about how we’re not as into literally spending all our time on side projects, and that’s ok. I do think they want to learn more about a variety of technologies, though.
- I think one of my short-term goals is going to be to hold workshops and informal discussion sessions. I’m not sure that we’re in a place where we want more meetups or hackathons, but super informal workshops/hangouts would be really cool. I think one of our biggest common challenges is a lot of us feeling intimidated by the idea of learning new technologies, because our department community is sometimes dominated by the people who have been coding their whole lives. My main goal, I think, is to make the tech world as friendly and accessible to the women at my school as possible.

### Location:
- We typically gather in Halligan, our CS building and center of all things CS at Tufts. It’s a lovely community space.
- We actually do not have a centralized online presence, and I’d love to see that improved.
- There is parking, but it requires a Tufts parking pass. As we are truly within the Tufts community, I don’t see this as a main problem for us.
- Again, we operate really in the Tufts community. Everyone is already sort of here.
- The space is free!
- Halligan is pretty great for all different types of meet ups and things. With all the different rooms, it ends up being quite flexible for different presentations and meet ups, and has very varying people capacities.
- I do believe that we have comfortable seating, but we could surely work on that as well. We have essentially the standard seating that Tufts has.
- We do bring snacks! It’s great. And we always have water right around the corner.

### Communication:
- This is _definitely_ something I’d like to work on. Right now communication is split up between our e-list, Facebook page, and word of mouth. I’m not sure Slack would be a good solution, but maybe if just to sync the FB page and e-list more easily, that would be quite helpful.
- Oh wow a GitHub organization might be perfect; that is something I have not yet considered. Like I said, I really don’t think a Slack is what we need, because we need more announcement-type communication. A Twitter might be good too…hm..

### Culture:
- I’d like to think our community is super welcoming to new people and new ideas. Right now we’re thinking about changing the name/other language to more explicitly include trans and nonbinary femme students, and not everyone necessarily agrees, but we’re talking through things well.
- At the end of the day, we actually do have a president who makes final decisions when there is a disagreement. However, she does so with lots of input from the board and club as a whole.
- We do not currently have policies in place! I’m not sure that we’re in a place to be ready for that yet, but I would be open to thinking about that.
- As someone with a green-blue-red conflict sequence, I tend to first provide others with information but then essentially step back and let others make decisions in conflict. At the end of the day though, if it’s something I feel super duper strongly about, I will push more to bring it up with the board.
