## Summary of the Community's Needs

My community is a reasonable sized (maybe 100-ish target audience) group of female and non binary college students who have loads of resources available to them but who may not know where to start. I will be working within the WiCS club, so some parts of this will be limited to that community as well.

My community prefers to communicate through Facebook, largely. Most communication is essentially one-sided, consisting mostly of announcements rather than dialogue, but we also have a lot of good dialogue crop up around those announcements. Facebook does provide a good platform for that need. 

The existing culture is one that _wants_ to see our community thrive, but is still very new and not yet super developed. One of my overarching goals will be to develop an educational framework through which we can better connect freshmen or very very new developers with slightly more experienced ones, usually upperclassmen.


## My Proposal

I think that I can make the biggest possible impact through small, informal, educational workshops. These could be held during the week or over the weekend, but I want them to be very low-key and chill, both due to my limited resources and because I think this would be best for not intimidating the brand new developers I am targeting. I hope to run several over the course of the semester; lets say at least 3. This will be great for freshmen just wandering into the club as well as for seniors just coming off their internships and excited for the future.

I hope that these workshops will help engage more of the community, particularly in groups that might otherwise not feel explicitly welcome in the tech world, like brand new developers, young women, people with disabilities, or people of color.

My main goal with these workshops is, as I said, to engage these people that otherwise don’t engage because they feel like there’s no way in or that it’s too much overhead to participate. I hope that these laid back workshops will show these women some pretty neat technology, and I hope that in turn will show them that what seems overwhelming right now is actually open and just waiting for them to get involved. 

As I said before, FB communication is working fairly well. However, to take a leaf from GH’s book, I think it would be really cool to livestream these workshops and keep a repository somewhere of tutorials and tips so that people can engage with them asynchronously. Finally, I’d like to further develop our Piazza page so that we can keep a running collection of asked and answered questions.


## My Proposal's Impact

- My target audience is mostly women and other URMs in tech who may feel intimidated by other tech meet ups and workshops. The specific need that I hope to address is the fact that many new developers get overwhelmed and don’t really know where to start wrt personal projects and online portfolios. 
- Resources needed include physical space, digital space, and people with knowledge to lead these workshops. The physical space is fairly easy to get; I need only ask the front office of our CS building. With the digital space, I believe it’s easy and free to get a solution that kind of works, but it would be great if GH could help with a solution that works even better. I wonder, would it be possible to keep my zoom pro account for this purpose? Finally, to get people to lead these workshops I’ll have to reach out to our upperclassmen and alumni community.
- I think my first step will be a Git & GitHub workshop. For this, I’ll pull from GH’s own training resources, and essentially walk the students through these tutorials. The second workshop I would like to hold would be one discussing online presence for applicants, in which we would talk about curating your personal website, resume, LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub. For this, I will work with Veronica and ask if I can share the deck that we gave in a workshop during my time here. For the other workshops, I plan to work with the other leaders of the community to determine what is needed and what will not otherwise be provided this semester.
- For the first two workshops I mentioned, I am reasonably personally knowledgable and am confident that I am well connected to resources like GH training team and GH recruiting that can help me flesh out those presentations. For any others, I’ll have to gauge my own expertise against what I would need to do an intro workshop, and possibly bring in some other upperclassmen to take the lead depending on the topic.
- I plan to begin this project this semester, and hopefully deliver 2-3 workshops over the course of the semester. It would be neat if I could give the Git + GitHub workshop early on, say maybe in September, so that I could give the Online Portfolio workshop before our career fair in October.

## Planning for the Future

I will review the impact both immediately after each workshop and at the end of the semester. I will measure success first by how many people attend the workshops; if only 2 show up, it will be hard to say that was a good impact on the community. After that, I will measure success by asking the people who do show up whether they feel more empowered, and I will ask the people who don’t show up why they didn’t, if applicable. I plan to formally iterate at the end of this semester and again at the end of the year, so that I can have sort of two trial periods before passing this project on to others when I graduate.
