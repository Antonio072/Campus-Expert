# Community moderation case study
+
+### Nature of the incident
+
+A classmate of mine made a post in a school CS Facebook page asking whehter Google made the right decision in firing James Damore.
+Lots of people had opinions on not only the whole Manifesto situation itself, but also about the fact that my classmate raised
+this question at all. Some comments were productive question-asking and argument-sharing, while some were more expression of emotion
+that sometimes got quite hostile.
+
+### Moderation action
+
+One moderator turned off commenting for the original post, and then the other made a pinned post on the group regarding their
+views on the manifesto itself, and then asking for opinions on the moderation action to be privately messaged. 
+
+### Outcome
+
+The outcome was sort of mixed. The mods turned off commenting for the first post and said that they were open to discussion about
+whether to turn it back on, but then didn't actually respond to that discussion. Further, the original poster actually just
+made another post, and the conversation continued, but this time fragmented because now it was across two posts.
+I think it did help to quench tempers temporarily, but overall I'm not sure it was the best possible outcome.
+
+### What could be different?
+
+I think one less-than-ideal thing about the situation is that the moderation came as a surprise to community members, and shut down
+very real communication that I personally think was just starting to become productive. After completing this module, I think
+that the community needs to have an agreed-upon code of conduct, instead of somewhat arbitrarily appointed mods who take action
+without warning. To that end, I have messaged the mods to talk about adding a CoC!
