# Hello!
My name is Lexi. I go to Tufts University, in Boston, and I am studying biopsychology and computer science. I'm also pre-med...for now... 
I've been hearing nothing but amazing things about this program all summer, and I am SO excited to join it now! 
My favorite emoji is ðŸ¦‘, the squid emoji! I love how it looks on Apple devices (https://emojipedia.org/squid/); it's so whimsical!
