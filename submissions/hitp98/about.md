# Introduction
Hi everyone! I'm Hithesh Peddamekala, a computer science major at Virginia Tech. I'm involved in the Galileo Living Learning Community as a mentor to 5 freshman. I'm the Sponsorship Chair for VTHacks, and Vice President of VTCSEC. I'm also involved with Hackers@VT, a community of students that hold tech workshops and are hackathon enthusiasts.
## Interests
I'm interested in web development, mobile development, and learning more about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm currently still trying to figure out what I enjoy coding the most. Outside of the dev world, I like to play tennis, basketball, work out, and read books occasionally.
