## Community Assessment

### Definition
Currently, the community at University of Colorado, Boulder (CU) is practically any student interested in tech.
HackCU, one of the many communities (there are a few other communities that are more niche to specific interests like Robotics, Design, Ethical Hacking, Women in Computing, IEEE chapter, Bitcoins, Data Science, etc.) at CU, is a student run hackathon organizing group.
What sets HackCU apart from other clubs (apart from the hackathon) is that we are inclusive to everyone (irrespective of they're interests) who is motivated to empower the community.
Currently, the events are mostly comprised of people who are studying computer science or are studying engineering.
Ideally, we'd like *everyone* to try their hand at "hacking" and want to make hackathons more welcoming to beginners.

### Size
Last year (2017), our hackathon got nearly 400 hackers from around USA.
The first hackathon organized by HackCU, in 2015, got 150 hackers from the Rocky mountain region.
The next hackathon, in 2016, expanded to 200 hackers.
We would like this community to continue growing at a steady rate.
We are aiming to reach ~500-600 hackers in 2018.
At the same time, we are striving to ensure that the hackathon size does not intimidate beginners that they decide not to participate.

### Resources
There are a multitude of resources on campus and around the campus that both students and other individuals who are interested in tech have access to.

On campus:
* CSEL - a lounge style area where students can hang out and talk about anything from Assembly to Dungeons and Dragons. Students here also have access to powerful machines to run heavy computations.
* BTU Lab - "Blow Things Up" Lab is another lab that students and professors have access to. Resources here include VR headsets, 3D printers and students here are encouraged to try new things and blow things up!
* Idea Forge - A space for thinkers to get together and work on their side project that has been put off for far too long. There is also a machine shop with mentors who are willing to help new-comers.

Off campus:
* Meetups - There are lots of meetups that go on in Boulder including Data Science, JavaScript, etc.
* Galvanize - A space that non-students have to work on their projects, startups, etc.
* Lots of seminars and workshops - Some of these also happen on campus

### Accessibility
Almost all of the resources available are accessible to everyone.
In fact, many of these resources are also regularly used by people with special needs.
The HackCU team meets on a time that is decided beforehand so as to prevent any collisions with classes and jobs.
The hackathon takes place on weekends and at least 2 weeks before the finals to ensure that everyone has the chance to participate.
This is true for the other clubs on campus - they usually pick a time in the evening when most people can make it.

### Interests
The hackathon is open to everyone, irrespective of what they study, who is interested in tech and is able to demonstrate that either by working on side projects or doing something similar.
However, the hackathon is mostly dominated by Computer Science students.
We are trying to overcome this by making the hackathon more accessible to beginners with the help of mock hackathons (hack nights), and beginner level workshops to spark interest.
Our team is more diverse in that we have students who belong to the business school.

The hackathon is very much open to all topics (as long as it's even remotely connected to tech).
This is perhaps one of the reasons why our hackathon does not insist on adhering hackers to specific tracks like Web, Mobile, Data Science, Hardware, etc.
We encourage the hackers to choose what *they* want to learn because that is the right way they will empower themselves - enough is already forced upon them at school and work!

### Goals
These are the goals for our hackathon as described by our bylaws:

> We always need HackCU to be:
 * Learning from other students
 * Being able to teach other students as a hacker
 * Go back home feeling like you know how to do something well
 * A motivating environment

Essentially, we want our community to be a place for collaborative learning and teaching tech.
Another goal described by our bylaws is:

> Keep it small enough that people can be less intimidated to try out their first hackathon [...] Itâ€™s important to get world class eventually. Bigger is inevitable

Right now, the hackathon is getting bigger while it's also getting intimidating.
And we feel that we're not abiding the goals outlined by the founders.
To tackle this, we are planning on conducting lots of beginner level workshops aimed at newbies and freshmen that lead up to the hackathon.

### Location
The team that puts together the hackathon meets every week at Idea Forge, a space for thinkers to work on their projects (see Resources section).
There is paid parking available here.
And the space here is accessible to both students (for free) and non-students.
So this space is probably the best place to hold our weekly meetings.
But there is not enough for our hackathon.
So the hackathon itself takes place at a different location.

Last year, it was at the Law building.
We ensured that we reserved the parking space for the building and made it available at no cost for participants.
This was the best event space we could find and it cost ~ $1,000 for 48 hours (including preparation and cleaning up).
We were able to comfortably fit 400 hackers plus mentors and sponsors.
We decided to forgo the university catering service and provided good (and healthy) food to hackers at no cost.

This probably wasn't the best venue.
And we're expanding this year, so we definitely need a better and larger venue for the 2018 hackathon.

### Communication
The team uses Slack for communicating with each other.
We also have a GitHub profile for the organization where we host our code (for websites and other services) for collaboration.
The hackathon participants also use Slack during the event for asking help, finding team mates, etc.
We also have a Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram account for announcing news.

While these are adequate during the hackathon, we want to start a mailing list to keep in touch with the community before and after the hackathon.

### Culture
Our community is always welcoming to new people and new ideas.
In fact, one of our goals is to be more welcoming to new-comers and beginners irrespective of their background.

In the past, there has been no great conflict between individuals (and I hope it stays the same).
The only disagreements we've had are trivial things like website design changes, choosing a venue for the hackathon, etc.
In those cases, we weigh the pros and cons of the different choices we have, present it to the entire team and take a vote.

In case of a major issue, I'd probably look at it from a neutral perspective and hear both sides of the argument.
Then I'd choose the *right* decision and let the other party know why it's right.
I think it's a good idea to have policies in place that help handle such situations.
