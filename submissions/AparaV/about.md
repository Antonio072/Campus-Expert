# About Apara

Hi! I'm Apara, and I'm a student at University of Colorado, Boulder studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
I'm also a part of the student hackathon organizing group HackCU, where I'm primarily involved with web and tech.

# Interests

When I'm not studying for my exams and putting together a hackathon, you can probably find me in the library working on my [next big thing](https://aparav.github.io/).
My tech interests are Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
Besides that, I love playing my guitar and spend my free time reading fantasy and sci-fi. And if you think *Game of Thrones* is better than *The Lord of the Rings*, we need to talk!

# Contacting Apara

You can reach me via email at apara.venkateswaran@gmail.com (I usually respond within 24 hours), or via Twitter @apara_v.
