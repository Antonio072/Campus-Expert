# Hubot Script

As the exercise for this module, I created my first Hubot, Alfred.
Alfred is the flamboyant butler your team needs to keep their spirits up!
Alfred is currently deployed to my (personal) Slack team where I experiment with new apps and integrations.

The script I added to Alfred teaches Alfred to do the following things:

* ```
	 apara: Why do we fall?
	alfred: @apara So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.
```

* ```
	 apara: @alfred the team needs some inspiration
	alfred: "The only thing standing between you and success is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't do it."
```

* ```
	 apara: Repeat "The food at HackCU is the best food at any hackathon!"
	alfred: "The food at HackCU is the best food at any hackathon!"
```
Sometimes he can be a bit cocky and won't repeat what you say. Perhaps that's why he is the butler you need.

Alfred is still learning and will be able to do more cool stuff in the future.

You can find the code for Alfred [here](https://github.com/AparaV/hubot-alfred).
And the script I wrote for Alfred is [here](https://github.com/AparaV/hubot-alfred/blob/master/scripts/inspire-me.coffee).

The repo has more detailed instructions to deploy Alfred onto your Slack team.
