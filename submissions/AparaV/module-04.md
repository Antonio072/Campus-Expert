# Git Workshop Outline
This is a plan for a 60 minute workshop that introduces Git and GitHub.

### Target Audience
The workshop is aimed at both beginners and experienced programmers who are not familiar with version control and Git. However it is not restricted to programmers alone. Git is a good tool to learn for everyone who works with multiple "versions" of a product. This includes writers, designers, etc.

### Learning Goals
1.	Understand what version control is and why we need it
2.	Install Git
3.	Create your first repository
4.	Introduction to GitHub and pushing your first repository
5.	Understand the need for branches and pull requests
6.	Understanding remotes, and good practices while contributing to open source
7.	Go away feeling confident that you will be able to use Git and collaborate on a group project

### Demonstrations and Examples
- Learners will have the chance to install Git on their laptops and test commands demonstrated
- Creating the "Hello World" repository
- Setup a GitHub account and push their repository live
- Contribute to an open source repo where they will introduce themselves to peers
	- Fork the repo and clone the fork locally
	- Create a new branch and commit changes
	- Create a PR and have it merged!

### Recovery Points
-	Give enough time for people to download Git. We can probably put the executables in a flash drive in case the internet fails.
-	Give them enough time to setup their GitHub account and link it with their Git client
-	Have one or two helpers who go around and help people who are facing issues

### Learner Participation
Questions to ask learners to create an engaging discussion
-	Why do you think we need a version control system? Where do you think people use it? Where have *you seen* it used?
-	What is open source? What is the hype all about?
-	Why do you think branches are necessary or recommended? Why not just make direct changes to production code?
Probably more interesting questions will come up during the workshop

### Adapting to your Participants
Ask the learners about the pace of the workshop after completing each learning outcome. Use this and the opinions of the helpers to judge the pace of the workshop.
-	If too slow, increase the pace and cover more ground including other cool features in GitHub â€“ CI, Integrations, Project Management Tool, Wikis, etc.
-	If too fast, slow down and explain each concept more carefully. Maybe even backtrack a few concepts and teach it again. We can stop with the introduction of GitHub and make the open source contribution exercise as a follow-up assignment to the workshop

### What happens after?
-	Provide them with other resources for learning git
	-	Email them a copy of the git cheat sheet
	-	Pro git book available at git-scm.com
	-	Other online tutorials for learning git
-	Learners can always ask questions or clarifications on the Slack channel
