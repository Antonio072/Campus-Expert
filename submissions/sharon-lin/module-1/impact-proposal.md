## Summary of the Community's Needs

Currently, my community is fairly diverse, although there is an abundance of opportunities available for students of all backgrounds. One useful change would be a way to help organize the opportunitie available in order to prevent students from constantly seeking out the same groups, and to diversify the interests. Another opportunity would be to offer these resources to students from nearby universities or online for anyone in the world to access.

- **Community demographics**: 11K+ students currently at MIT, generally undergrad/grad students, access to department + lab resources (CSAIL, Course 6, MIT Media Lab, etc.)
- **Communication**: Primary means of communication through mailing lists
- **Culture**: Culture is fast-paced, focused more on computer science than hardware/mechE

## My Proposal

I'd like to build an online resource to help students find new opportunities on campus. This can be used for students from MIT and other campuses, as well as internationally (a future feature may be to sort by larger geographic regions). 

1. Create a mailing list that includes regular events and opportunities
2. Transition into online site that features various events sorted by topic/interest group
3. Include locations to sort events
4. Incorporate ways to plan events for MIT

- **Timing**: Release first step in early August. Begin building out next steps over the course of the month. Maintain the web resource over fall semester. 
- **Community demographics**: Increasing awareness of events that feature under-represented groups in tech for those interested. Make resources available more freely than through specific mailing lsits.
- **Goals**: Targets students interested in new opportunities to build their career and skills, as well as to meet new people from different interest groups
- **Communication**: In-person meetups, online groups, mailing lists

## My Proposal's Impact

- Target audience
  - College students in the NYC/BOS area
- Community needs

  - Creating mailing list [silicon_rally()]
- Content knowledge
  - Knowledge on latest events happening around NYC/BOS
  - Student groups, mailing lists + announcements
- Timeline
  - Aug 9: Launch silicon_rally()
  - Aug 20: Create beta version of online resource
  - Aug 22: Make contribution available to users

  - TBA: Present to undergrad community

## Planning for the Future

- Reach
  - I plan on measuring metrics to see how many students I will reach
- Success
  - I plan on completing surveys to see which areas are successful and which may require more work 
- Iterations
  - After measuring silicon_rally(), I hope to build out a network of college student-focused meetup groups in the BOS area
