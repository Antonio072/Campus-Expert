## About Me

Hi! I'm Sharon, and I'm a rising freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I'll be studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I was an organizer for CodeDay NY and StuyHacks in high school, and I'm excited to meet the other Campus Experts!

## Experience

I've worked on several internships at the US Department of State, CERN, and NYU while I was in high school. I primarily focused on web development or mobile development, although I am interested in VR filmmaking, cybersecurity, and data science. I've also worked on a few research projects in ML, and I love talking about inventions and philosophy. Outside of CS, I really like to bake, write stories and poems, and talk about movies!
