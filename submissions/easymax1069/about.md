# Hi I'm Israel

I study Computer Science at [Yaba College of Technology](http://www.yabatech.edu.ng/).
I'm currently focused on mobile and web development and I have a desire to learn new technologies.

I am excited to be paticipating in the GitHub campus experts program and want to use this plateform to contribute to my community.

I'm currently interning at [One Percent Lab](http://onepercentlab.com/), which has given me the oppotunity to be familier with some few awesome web technologies

ðŸ˜‚ is my favorite emoji.
