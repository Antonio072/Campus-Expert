## Summary of the Community's Needs

I will now attempt to summarise the key sections that I will tackle with my proposal. These are by no means the only areas in need of improvement, but they are the ones I feel will bring a more positive change to our community in the alloted timeline (1 academic year) to my proposal. Should the proposal expand over the course of next year, this Summary will also be edited to include which new sections are being looked into.

### Demographics

Data from the 2016/17 year has our number of registered members at 65 students: 15% of them belonging to non computing departments, the remaining belonging to the Department of Computing. As part of the Students' Union, all members are current students at Goldsmiths, University of London, with varying degrees of knowledge, even among students from similar programs. My proposal shall target the totality of our community, in regards to interaction between members, and will also target the resources currently available to them, as well as making them more accessible overall.

### Communication

Our community seems to have a preference for communicating over Facebook, using our Page to interact with our posts about upcoming events and our Tech Forum Group to just post general questions and calls for help. It is open to everyone so people outside our community can always reach out to our members.

We also have a Twitter and an Instagram account, which we use to let our members know of any upcoming events and, during events, as a brief recap of what is currently happening.

### Resources

Currently our available resources include a series of weekly events where members can come and socialise and/or work on personal and group projects, a monthly talk or workshop, 5 larger hackathons, and a smaller number of one-off events such as Lovelace (our minorities in computing hack day), HEBOCON (robot wars) and Local Hack Day.

## Proposal

The following proposal attempts to tackle the topics of Demographics, Communication and Resources. I call it the EEE Plan for Enrichment (for Resources), Engagement (for Communication), and Enhancement (for Demographics). I shall divide this section into these 3 areas, further detailing how they would work. Each of these plans shall run concurrently throughout the academic year, adding to our already scheduled projects.

### Enhancement

Enhancement will focus on diversifying our demographics, attempting to bring non-computing students to our community and enhancing those who already are part of it. By doing so, I believe members will benefit from a bigger knowledge pool, by networking with future/possible members with different backgrounds, and thus a different way of looking at problems.

This shall happen during our weekly meetups where current members will be actively encouraged to bring a friend from different programs, to show them what our community looks like. Laila, who runs the weekly series, will serve as a mentor and facilitator. These events should also actively encourage a "Show and Tell" so existing members showcase their current side or university projects, further exposing future/possible members to our core principles.

We have also expanded our committee to include members of other societies' committees, such as Anthropology and Psychology, that also share our ideals and have integrated perfectly within our community. This will enable us to reach an even wider audience and, ideally, and as we keep delivering engageable content, will make that wider audience recognise our value and continue further strenghtening these ties, even after I leave the committee. The societies I mentioned are by no means the solely targets of this proposal and are simply what I foresee as points of lower resistance.

### Engagement

Engagement will focus on current members interacting with one another, promoting a culture of unity, by expanding the banner of our in-person events to a semi-permanent solution, by taking it online. Social media is, however, used in different ways by different people and, as such, we'll initially need to poll our community to ascertain how people use the existing channels and where they'd like to reach other members.

Understanding our community will allow us to make a better decision on what platform to use and, if it's an existing platform, how to better utilise it. It will also, hopefully, help us gauge the level of interest of our community in using an online platform to interact from within, or if our members prefer engaging with other members on an event-only basis.

Furthermore, expanding our physical events to have a bigger online footprint, would enable members of our community that weren't able to come, to still interact, on a passive or active manner. Our social media volunteer would have his/her/their role expanded by not only live-blogging the event but also take small notes so that, post-event, a full write-up could be posted online, detailing what happened during the event in more detail. This role could also be given to a member of a writing society, which could possibly upskill said member, by giving him/her/them a platform, while at the same time allowing for our readers to have an arguably unbiased view of our events.

### Enrichment

Enrichment will focus on upskilling members outside of hackathons, as a way of giving a palpable reward for belonging to our community. We hope that this will also give them the confidence that comes with knowledge, and to take on a more substantial role in our projects. This will be done by a series of Workshops/Seminars, ideally on a fortnightly basis, that will tackle issues that may be relevant to the community. They won't all be purely technical, as that could deter some people that are less confident, to attend them.

Example topics may include: "Security, Privacy and Digital Rights", "Swarm Intelligence and Mimicking Biology" and "Translating Natural Language to Computer Language".
These topics will be completely introductory and will instead focus on areas that people with a general interest in technology seem to find interesting, from our own personal findings, and those which we can survey implicitly throughout the year. Some of these areas have been explored by Goldsmiths lecturers, which I'm sure wouldn't mind helping us as we have a great relationship with them, or even introducing the topic themselves.

Other topics may include: "Introduction to Git", "Introduction to DevOps".
These topics are of a more technical nature, however, I feel that most people can still enjoy them. Git as version control is useful to most students and academics, and DevOps, although being more related to software project management, can still be watered down to simple project management and how to organise a group, both of which are fundamental to student life and, consequently, our community.

I also see later workshops as being community-led. During term 2, I will mention that, should anyone have a presentation they'd like to do, they're free to do so, encouraging a diversity of topics, and not necessarily technical ones. Students showing interest in presenting, will receive training on how to deliver talks/workshops, a distilled analysis on talks/workshops already presented and a pre and post analysis on their delivery. Given enough interest, I will ideally have a community of presenters that, in my absence, will have the necessary tools to deliver high quality content and recruit other students wishing to do so.

Being a part of a community should have a substantial reward attached to it, in my opinion, and I consider these topics to be of such importance. Should they prove successful they could also attract new members, simply by attendees mentioning them to friends and colleagues. This would translate in an increase in size of our community that, if run correctly, could impact future years.

## Proposal's Impact

### Target Audience

The EEE Plan will affect our entire community and attempt to also affect current Goldsmiths students, enticing them to join our community.

### Community Needs

I will be attempting to address a sense of coesion within our community to bring our members together and also what I identify to be lacking aspects in students' knowledge pools, not filled by most lectures. A community that was brought together by a common passion for technology deserves having as many resources available to them, being in terms of networking or hard/soft skills.

### Resources

Most resources will be provided by the university and by our society. We have access to most rooms on campus and will be planning according to expected audience size.

### Media

I will be bringing up my proposal to the committee and start preparations accordingly. Workshops and seminars will be prepared from September onwards.

### Content Knowledge

My knowledge on public speaking and managing online communities, which is arguably the core of my proposal, isn't really formal: as far as online communities are concerned, I have a fair bit of experience, mostly due to playing online games and managing people in that context; regarding public speaking, I have given a few presentations during my academic progress and, more recently, given a talk on DevOps during our last hackathon. 
Even though I'm a firm believer of learning through doing, I do have some people in the Hacksmiths committee with experience in public speaking and online communities that will help me, should I require.

### Timeline

This plan is projected to run during terms 1 and 2 in the 2017/18 year, breaking when our community is on holidays and/or exam times. 

The seminars/workshops will be scheduled to start on the 2nd month of classes and every 2 weeks henceforth. These will run for around 20 minutes, with 10 minutes for a Q&A and wrap up. The content for seminars/workshops will be gathered during October, by meeting with especialised lecturers to better deliver accessible content, and during December, after gathering feedback from students and attendees to understand which direction these topics could take.

### Conclusion

This wasn't mentioned throughout the Proposal's Impact, however, the reason I enrolled in the GitHub Experts was to also have access to the combined pool of knowledge of other experts in different universities, and will be able to better change, or adapt, my proposal. The training provided should also prove very useful as most of my knowledge on these matters comes from personal experience. As such, modules like "Community Management", "Public Speaking", "Workshop Development" and "Technical Writing" should provide a good starting point for my EEE Plan.

## Planning for the Future

I shall attempt to keep a detailed measure of the success rate of my proposal. This will include attendance numbers with Enrichment, and how active the community gets for Engagement. I will coordinate with the leader of the weekly meetups to gauge the success rate of Enhancement, and consider it successful if we increase our non-computing students' percentage. Periodic meetings with our diversity officer will happen to better ascertain whether EEE is being effective in its message.

A detailed review will be made every month measuring the previously mentioned criteria. During the weeks leading to the monthly analysis, feedback will be gathered from students attending talks/seminars and weekly events. This will be in the form of online polls or direct engagement with attendees.

I will consider any aspect of the EEE plan unsuccessful should it get low approval from polled members of our community or, relating to talks/seminars, if these show low attendance numbers.

After monthly revision, the EEE Plan will change and try to adapt accordingly, if necessary. Minor changes will be in effect during term and major changes between terms. These changes shouldn't happen outside reviews.

Trialling of new features could happen at any point but only with an appropriate amount of research: gauging interest; detailed in full. Feedback will be required after any new feature implemented, from the community and the committee.

Should any of the EEE features need changing, this will only happen after a monthly review.
