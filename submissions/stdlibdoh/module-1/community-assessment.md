## Community Assessment


### Background

I am currently a committee member for Hacksmiths, a tech society at Goldsmiths, University of London, whose main focus is to organise and run hackathons for students. As such, my Community Assessment will closely follow what we, as a society, experience, debate and strive for. I will attempt to remain neutral, with some of my points being what I plan on bringing up to discussion with the committee once the next term starts.

It is also worth mentioning that all instances of 'Community' shall refer to Goldsmiths students who currently are members of Hacksmiths. As event organisers, our major events gather students from different universities and, even though they are considered to be part of our extended community, their needs are better served on an event-by-event basis, rather than a year long action plan.

### Definition

Our community can best be defined as a group of Goldsmiths students with a passion for technology.

Even though this is mostly appealing to students from the Department of Computing, we aim to be as inclusive as possible to students that don't necessarily come from STEM fields but nonetheless synergise quite well with technology, and ideally I'd like to see a bigger participation from non computing students.

In order to do so, we're looking to partner with other community leaders in the university in order to reach a wider audience. This won't necessarily change our core principles but rather expand them in ways that we've seen beneficial in events we've run.

My proposal will also expand on this topic and how our community can go from being majorly computing students interested in technology and hackathons, to any student generally interested in technology.

### Size

We currently have 65 registered members, with around 15% belonging to departments other than the Department of Computing.
Ideally I'd like to see these numbers being bolstered by 20% to 30%, as we recently ran a very successful hackathon that managed to get the attention of a BBC-made documentary which gave us a lot of publicity.

We also went through some management and committee changes last year and overall, I feel our committee has a lot more unity and sense of purpose in achieving our goals but, nonetheless, we have yet to see our efforts reaping any rewards, as most planning has been done with the following year in mind.

Personally, I feel that word of mouth is the most effective tool in recruiting new members. As such, a simple "bring a non computing friend" addition to our weekly meetups would be a good way to start diversifying our demographics. On top of that, I feel that the workshops/seminars outlined in the "Resources" section, could be a way of improving how students see our community, and how they can fully benefit from being a member of our community, and disperse that message among their peers.

### Resources

Given that our main focus is organising and running hackathons, I feel that between workshops/talks that happen during the events, mentoring from the organisation's volunteers and several hardware and API related expertise provided by sponsors, the majority of topics are covered. There is always space for improvement, however I feel that that discussion around resourcing these events is best left to an event-by-event basis.

We also run a weekly event, on campus, where our community can meet to work on university or side projects and socialise, monthly workshops/talks on certain topics, with their duration being around 2 hours, and a number of one-off events, with varying target audiences.

Overall, I feel that there's a lot of space for improvement regarding learning resources outside of a hackathon environment, as there's only so much lectures cover and I feel that we, as a student society, are better suited to attend to these needs.

As such, I believe that weekly or fortnightly workshops/seminars could introduce our community to industry tools, such as Git, or even just group work management, such as a brief intro to DevOps and better prepare our community for the future.

### Accessibility

We try to keep our resources as accessible as possible and benefit a lot from the fact that, as a university society, and since our usual meetups are on campus, we gain every perk that students get, including childcare. Weekly meetups are also held on a day the university timetabling team usually leaves open for society events, with hackathons held usually during Term and generally avoiding Exam Season.

### Interests

Even though, as previously mentioned, our demographic is mostly comprised of students belonging to the Department of Computing, I feel that the interest and openness to other topics is very much present. This is apparent by the kind of student that Goldsmiths attracts, usually being very much in touch with creativity, and something I've experienced when, during our events, I see students from very different backgrounds collaborating on a hack.

Given that the openness is already there, I feel like improving and broadening the communities' interests is very much directly related to increasing the size, and diversity, of our demographics, outlined in the "Size" section.

### Goals

There's several reasons people are interested and participate in our events and our community. From a personal standpoint, based on people I've spoken with during events, most of them seem to just generally be interested in computing and would like to know more about it - some with a pure childlike curiosity, others very much focused on getting a job straight out of university. These are all goals that align due to the majority of the community just being very proactive and eager to learn.

These are also goals that can be more effectively achieved by the outlined seminars and workshops I've mentioned on the "Resources" section and the reason I'm proposing them.

### Location

All of our events and weekly gatherings are done on campus, thus benefiting from university's resources such as proximity to snacks and drinks, free room bookings catering to large or small audiences, and this location is overall central to students' lives.

We have a Facebook page for our members to share and post questions and other issues. I am, however, looking into options for an online platform, for a more sense of community union, which I will touch more upon in the "Communication" section and fully outline in my proposal.

### Communication

We use Facebook and Twitter for general interest posts to reach our community. We also mainly use Facebook as a forum where our community members can interact with each other, however, most of engagement seems to be on the organisation's posts, rather than between members. We used to have a Slack server for a while, however, it was generally not very active and, as such, was closed this year. There wasn't, in my personal opinion, an active push on Slack to engage the community and have members engage with one another, and it served a purpose very much like our Facebook pages, which made it needless.

I think there's a lot of room for improvement in this aspect. Even though we seem to get our message across to our commmunity just fine, I feel like a dedicated chatroom platform could benefit our community in finding partners for group work (university/side projects), or even just as a way to socialise. I've been personally looking into how big communities use Slack and Discord to communicate and I'd like to explore what options would better suit our community.

### Culture

I feel that, generally, and as previously mentioned, Goldmismiths students are very much open to new and different ideas, and the whole university fosters a culture of openness. It is also something we gain, as a university society, with this culture already being so common among faculty and students alike. Regardless, we do understand that, as event organisers, disputes may happen and will have to be promptly solved. As such we have a Code of Conduct we enforce at every event we organise, by which all attendees must abide. This code of conduct is quite comprehensive, however, should anything fall outside that spectrum, we still have the Students' Union and the college itself to act as moderators.
