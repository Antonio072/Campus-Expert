# Workshop outline 

## Intro to Swarm Intelligence: Mimicking Biology

### Introduction

This will be an extended version of a workshop I intend to present, as part of my EEE Plan, described on my community impact proposal.
It will attempt to explain what Swarm Intelligence is by introducing the "Stochastic Diffusion Search" algorithm, henceforth referred simpy as SDS, and a simple implementation of it, in a popular programming language (JavaScript). 
The timeline section will detail the pacing of the workshop, starting with a brief introduction of the swarm intelligence field. The implementation will happen in 3 stages, each stage talking attendees through a core principles of the algorithm. I feel like breaking the algorithm into 3 joinable parts serves the purpose of both allowing attendees to take several breaks to better assimilate the concept and tackling smaller problems rather than one massive one.
This workshop was designed under the assumption of being held in Goldsmiths, University of London, however, the only section affected by this, is "Pre-Workshop Research and Possible Extras".
Some programming knowledge would be required, which will further be discussed under section "Adapting to your participants".

### Timeline

1. Introduction and icebreaker
2. Defining swarm intelligence, real-world applications, visual demonstration
3. Algorithm presentation, defining the 3 core principles
    3.1. Defining Fitness function, implementation.
    3.2. Defining Testing function (inner loop), implementation
    3.3. Defining Communication function (outer loop), implementation
4. Putting the pieces together, implementing the algorithm
5. Wrap-up, conclusion, where to go next

### Learning Goals

1. Introduce swarm intelligence
2. Understand real-world applications and different types of swarm intelligence algorithms
3. Implement a swarm intelligence algorithm, in JavaScript

### Pre-Workshop Research and Possible Extras

This section will focus on enhancing the experience for attendees and, in order to do so, I would try to get a small participation by one of the Goldsmiths, University of London, lecturers, as he has done extensive work in the field and has in fact contributed to the research paper containing the SDS algorithm.
Another participation I would try to get would be a 3rd year student from the university, who, in the previous year, implemented a visual implementation of a different swarm intelligence algorithm in Unity. Should he prove unavailable, I would try to get his permission to display his work.
I feel like these two contributions would give attendees a certain degree of confidence in attempting the workshop, both in terms of hearing from a lecture that has a proven record in the field, both in terms of research and real-world applications, and hearing from a student, such as them, whose work would be a decent addition.

### Demonstrations and Examples

Demonstrations and Examples will include real-world applications of swarm intelligence algorithms, such as their use in the medical, financial and other fields. Attempts will also be made to show a visual implementation of an algorithm, as detailed in the previous section.

### Discussions and pairing opportunities

Attendees will be paired in groups (size to be decided based on estimated attendance), based on a series of factors detailed in section "Adapting to your participants". Throughout the workshop, there will be roughly 25 minutes of group-work and/or discussions and brain-storming, as groups attempt to solve each section of the algorithm.

### Recovery points

Should any group of attendees fall behind, or just wish to take a break during the scheduled group-work, a GitHub repository will detail the steps required to catch-up, including workable code, which can then be used to carry on to the following stage.

### Learner participation

As already detailed in section "Discussions and pairing opportunities", attendees will be encouraged, as a group, to attempt each step of the algorithm until, by the end, they have a fully workable implementation.

## Adapting to your participants

An initial poll will be conducted, during the week following the workshop, to ascertain attendees' level of knowledge on general algorithms and on the programming language being used. This poll won't be exhaustive and instead focus on gauging attendees' level of confidence in algorithms and JavaScript.
This poll will be the main drive in forming groups, as attendees less knowledgeable or less confident will be paired with confident ones. Attendees coming in groups, will be asked if they wish to maintain their original group or be semi-randomly paired.
Size of the groups will also be determined by the number of participants choosing to attend the workshop, with groups no bigger than 5-7 people.

## What happens after

The same GitHub repository, detailed in section "Recovery Points", will also have extra information on the swarm intelligence field. This will include links to research papers on algorithms, including the one implemented during the workshop, along with a set of suggested steps distilling the essence of those algorithms, and suggested implementations.

## Conclusion and final thoughts

I had an internal debate concerning the pacing of the workshop and whether having the algorithm broken down into 3 connectable parts would may be fragmenting too much. However, having spoken with a few colleagues, most of them belonging to the target audience of this workshop, I can assume with some degree of certainty that this is an appropriate way of doing so.
