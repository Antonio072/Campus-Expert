# Talk Proposal

### Introduction

After hearing the suggestion to "Write something you'd like to have heard a year ago", I decided to talk about my personal experience, as a 31 year old, with university. I've been keen on write a blog post on that topic for a while, seeing how so many people have asked me about it, but have been postponing it for lack of time. It is by no means a technical talk and more about how I dealt with a scenario that seemed familiar yet was entirely foreign, and will be addressing fears and concerns that not only affect mature students but new university students as well.

## Title

The 30 year old student

### Abstract

Starting a university degree can be daunting, right? What if it's in a different country? What if you don't have any practical experience with the subject? What if you're substantially older than most of your colleagues?

We will be talking about my personal experience in dealing with what seemed like a completely foreign environment, keeping the impostor syndrome at bay and how these life lessions can be applied in other scenarios. We will explore how it feels to step outside your comfort zone, and how framing the unknown in a familiar light can sometimes ease anxiety.

### Description

This talk is aimed at all students, regardless of programme of study or age. You'll be taken on a personal telling of a 2nd year computing student, that decided to enrol at the age of 30, to follow his dream of pursuing a job he liked, shedding away his retail skin in the process. You'll hear how his life experiences in different countries, and with little similarities, helped him understand a new situation; how he taught himself to deal with feeling like the odd-person-out, and how he was able to find friends that helped him through troubled times.

By the end of it, you'll hopefully take home with you a new story: one that you may use to shed light on problems you'll face or are facing; one that may help you ease the start of big life changes; one that may show you that common goals are easier to find than common conflict. If all these fail, let's hope the story is enjoyable and you'll leave with a smile on your face and a new friend in Wilson (he may be old but he's seen things).
