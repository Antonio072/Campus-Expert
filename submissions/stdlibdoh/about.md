## Intro
Hi everyone,

My name is Wilson and I'm a Computer Science student at Goldsmiths, about to start year 2.

## Community Involvement
I'm involved with Hacksmiths, a student run society that organises hackathons and several other events. Joined the team for term 2 and helped plan and run Anvil Hack III. I'm also involved with the Peer-Assisted Learning Program at my university.

## Tech Interests
A bit about me: I usually describe myself as a technological butterfly, fluttering between areas and basically trying to figure out what I like and what I don't like. Last year my focus was on Swarm Intelligence Algorithms and next year, aiming to focus my shit towards Security.

## Hobbies
Hobbies include cycling through the 'Terrible TV Shows - Amazing Movies - Being terrible at VideoGames' loop and eating (eating is an amazing hobby).
