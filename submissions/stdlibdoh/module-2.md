# Community Moderation Action - Case Study

## Introduction

The following happened to a small community I managed in some capacity.

I used to play a lot of online games and, on occasion, I was not only playing but managing a group of people throughout several stages of the game. The incident I will describe happened a few years ago while playing World of Warcraft. This is an online only game where players sometimes join a "guild" or a community of like minded people with a similar goal. At the time, the guild I was in was just a conglomerate of people with no discernible goal, however, after polling our members, I found that a good number of them wanted to go through the contents of the game, which required coordination. I had prior experience doing so and, along with a close friend, started running a few boss encounters on a very casual manner. I was purely dealing with logistics: making sure we had enough people to run the events and dealing with recruitment if not. My friend was in charge of taking our members through the encounters, using voice chat to communicate tactics and adjustments. This incident happened during one such time.

## Nature of the incident

During a boss encounter that went especially bad, one of the players that, even though didn't belong to our guild, joined our group fairly regularly, complained through voice chat that she was having some problems performing her role in the group. She had, on different occasions, spoken out on several different issues, but mostly through text messages, and this was her first time using voice communication. This, in turn, identified her as belonging to the female gender which caused a childish reaction by part of one of the other members, who belonged to our guild. He started writing on chat something along the lines of "Ohh, a guuurllll" quite insistently. After we resumed our event, he stopped.

## Moderation action

Wanting to diffuse the situation, I messaged my friend to communicate to the rest of the group to focus on the task at hand and resume the event. Since he was the one speaking throughout the event, I felt that he should be the only one communicating, to avoid confusion. I was also not sure if all listening members knew me by my voice and didn't want anyone to think that the order to continue was coming from a member and not from a leader.

## Outcome

The offending player left our guild a few days later, and the offended player continued joining our group the following weeks so I was unable to accurately gauge if our response was adequate or not. Nonetheless, no other similar issues ever occurred.

## What could be different

From the knowledge I gained with this module, I believe I should've messaged the offending player instantly, reminding him of our "Guild Rules", very similar to a Code of Conduct, and warning him that if he insisted on making other players feel uncomfortable, I would be forced to remove him from our group event and possibly our guild. I should've also let my friend remind everyone, on voice chat, about our rules and to be respectful to all of our players, even if coming from outside the main group, with action being taken if those rules weren't being followed.

## Conclusion

Both me and my friend were coming from very formal and very strict guilds and, as we spoke about it once the event was over, were quite taken aback by what was happening, as we initially weren't even understanding what was going on. We were also running these events on a very casual and part-time capacity but, nonetheless, I feel we should've handled that situation a lot better than we did. The situation solved itself, which was fortunate, but I know that that is not often the case.
