hello!!! ✨

my name is Emily, i'm currently studing Computer Science at University College London. 
i'm entering my final year so that's terrifying (and exciting! 🚀). 

over the last 2 years i have done a lot of awesome stuff with UCL TechSoc, as well as the London Chapter of She++! 

with TechSoc i had the opportunity to run Porticode last year which was a beginner-focused hackathon at UCL. with she++ 
i do the events and hackathons, so i run an annual hackathon called She Codes London in November, as well as other workshops 
and talks.

at the moment, i am the organiser of DjangoGirls London (DjangoGirls is completely awesome and if you havent heard of it you 
should totally check it out 💗).

i also work with UCL's Computer Science dept to try and make the department more inclusive and accessible, as part of the 
Athena SWAN committee. i'll be running a London tech newsletter starting in september as well!

im really into web dev at the moment, especially Vue.js, and i also am in love with GraphQL 😍

my favourite emoji is 100% the sunflower 🌻 its so beautiful

verrrryyy looking forward to this!
