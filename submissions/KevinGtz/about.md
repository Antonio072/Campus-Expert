Hello there!

I'm Kevin Loyola, a computer ingeniering student at UNAM. 
When I was a kid I did not think I was going to study computering, however, I always wanted to study engineering.
Today I love computer science because it taught me many things and you have to keep learning in order to stay updated.I like programming specially for web technologies, i use Python, Bootstrap, Flask, and GCP to make websites and platforms.

I am also a member of a student community called GDG UNAM, we are a group of friends where we want to improve the values and technical knowledge of our team and our classmates.
In order to do that, we make workshops, meetups, conferences and awesome events such as Hackthons. 

P.D. I'm sorry for my bad english, i still learning.
