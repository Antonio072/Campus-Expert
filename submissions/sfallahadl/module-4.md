# Workshop outline

When I started my internship this summer, I realized that I was not very confident in using GitHub. 
This was a problem because many companies use GitHub and assume that student come to their internship with this skill.
Sometimes schools overlook teaching things that are important in industry, and I would like to create a GitHub workshop for students.

## Plan
- Learning goals.
  - Be confident in using common GitHub commands.
  - Learn how to create a local repository, commit, branch, and GitHub repository.
  - Merge a PR.
- Demonstrations and examples.
  - Show students all the benifits of using GitHub.
  - Discuss how companies use GiHub and talk about different exmaples.
- Discussions and pairing opportunities.
  - Students will work in groups of 2 and create a GitHub repository together.
  - Then, students will work on making their local repository, a commit and branch on their own.
  - Students will then pair up again and learn how to merge their code to the GitHub respository.
- Recovery points.
  - After the lesson, students will have plenty of time to apply all their skills.
  - Students who fall behind can get help from more experienced students, or the leader of the workshop.
- Participatory learning.
  - Students will be asked if they understand GitHub commands.
  - Students will also be asked to shar their experience using it (if they have in the past).
  - There will also be time for students to ask specific questions, or things they have gotten stuck on outside of the workshop.
- Adapting to your participants.
  - I will ask the students to split up into 2 groups: those who have some experience with GitHub and those who do not.
  - I will have everyone working in pairs(an experienced person with a non-experienced person).
- What happens after?
  - I can create documents for students to refer when they leave the class. They can use this if they forget the concepts that they learned in the workshop.
  - I will also create a Facebook page for people to ask eachother questions.
