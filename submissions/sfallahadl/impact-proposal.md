## Summary of the Community's Needs


The community assessment helped assist with the fact that there are resources at ASU, but it seems to be disconnected. The community, especially freshmen who come to the campus are overwhelmed with the size and what the school has to offer that they never quite find what they were looking for. We spent the last semester organizing a hackathon to welcome beginners into the tech field but our organization was not the only one to do this, 2 other hackathons arised just 2 weeks apart from each other. After addressing the concern of the organizational disconnect with Joe, a more solidified idea started forming. There is a way to fortify the community and it is to connect beginners/freshmen alike to join and take part in the community to have them one day pass on the baton to the next batch. If we can bring the community together, organizations may soon follow and support each other for a thriving community. 

An event like GitHub Field Day will bring all the resources and communities together. This will allow students to discuss important topics and to create more unity within our tech community.

## Your Proposal

With the help of GitHub, I will work with other students to create a stronger tech community in my area. I attended the GitHub field day in San Francisco and it really inspired me to help host a similar event at my school. I want to help create a community where students in tech can come together and discuss topics that are important to them. I will work with Anisha Gupta and other student leaders in our school to bring the tech organizations at our school together.


- **Timing**: 

| Week |Title|Description| 
|:----:|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   3  | Research Past Events/Choose Event Type | Understand which freshmen/beginner friendly events work best. Large Scale Hackathon? University Wide Tech Day? 
|   4-5  |  Research/Recruitment of current  Freshmen/Sophomores, Faculty, Organizations      | We currently have joined forces with one hackathon team, start having people more involved |
|   6  | Create a Timeline of event planning process | Have a structured plan and task list in order to assess what should be done over summer to have a successful back to school event|
- **Community demographics**: On the school front, planning on reaching out to more organizations within the school and faculty members that are heavily involved. On the company front, reach out to past companies that were involved and be more involved with hackerrnest socials to discover new potentially interested community partners. 
- **Goals**: 
    - Understanding and Aligning the interests and goals of different components in the community
        - Students 
        - Organizations
        - Faculty/School 
        - Companies  
- **Communication**: Facebook has proven to be helpful when connecting the computer science community here, Maybe for clubs an overall Google Drive. Would love any reccomendations!  


## Your Proposal's Impact

The proposal aims to address the problem of the community being disconnected in certain areas such as communication and events that are being held. It will also encourage organizations at ASU to communicate with eachother about events and opportunities. 

When identifying the impact of your proposal, you should focus on the following areas:
- Target audience
  - Students at Arizona State University just starting to gain interest in growing and becoming a part of the tech community. 
- Community needs
  - A unifying way to distinguish all the awesome clubs, programs, and events that are held for those interested in technology 
- Resources
**Will Add More Resources When Neccessary**
  - What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
      - Ways to strengthen communication
      - When researching some past resources
  - How will you obtain those resources?
      - Participating in discussions
      - Connecting more with the Github Campus Expert Community 

- Media
  - How are you preparing to deliver your community impact project?
      - Event
          - Pictures, Video, Website?, Emails
  - What are you going to do to prepare to deliver the content?
      - Form a team of current freshmen/beginners, reach out to existing orgs 
- Content knowledge
  - How knowledgeable are you on about the topic your community impact project focuses on?
      - Was part of the team that hosted a hackathon catered to 500 people
      - Understanding the school impact and the traction it has
  - What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?
      - Formed connections with orgs, companies, and faculty in the CS and higher departments 
- Timeline
  - Develop a rough timeline for your community impact project.

## Planning for the Future

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
    - After my community's GitHub Field Day.
- How will you measure success?
    - Can take feedback surveys and how many newcomers we were able to reach out to
    - Ask in the survey if the event gave them valuable information about growing the tech community in our area.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
    - Yearly depending on size of event.
