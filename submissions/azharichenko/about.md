# About Me

Hello, My name is Alex Zharichenko. I study computer science at the University of Pittsburgh and I'm heavily involved with projects made by my schools computer science club. I'm also expanding into other coding communities around Pittsburgh such as Code and Supply.

## Hobbies/Interests

I'm an audiophile meaning I spend insane amounts of money on audio equipment but it's my hobbie. I have multiple pairs of headphones, many vinlys that are fun to collect and listen to, and various amplifiers, digital to analog converters, speakers, subwoofers, etc. Trust me it makes coding super joyful when you have very clear and vibrant music playing in your ears.
