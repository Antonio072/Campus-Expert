# About Aishik

Hi! I'm Aishik Saha a Computer Science and Engineering undergrad at [SRM University](www.srmuniv.ac.in). I built [Slyme](https://5ly.me), a URL shortener for enterprise. I think the best part about being in tech right now, are the amazing communities. :heart:

## Interests

Cloud Computing :cloud: and Artificial Intelligence :space_invader: are hands down my most favorite fields of interest. I'm interested in learning how to design scalable platforms and services, and using AI to automate and make life easier.
