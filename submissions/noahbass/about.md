# About Noah

Hey all! 

I'm a computer science major entering my 3rd year (of a five year program) at the University of Cincinnati (UC) in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.

__On campus involvement__

I love being a part of the hacker culture and community. On campus I am marketing lead at [RevolutionUC](https://revolutionuc.com/), UC's student hackathon,
and secretary at [ACM@UC](https://acmatuc.org/), UC's hack club and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) chapter.

__Interests__

My technical interests include data engineering and data science, cloud computing, and web development!

Outside of tech I enjoy playing and watching soccer. I find the soccer community to be inviting, exiting, and diverse.

__Professional experience__

This past summer I interned at [Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/) for software and data engineering. Previously I've interned at
[Siemens PLM](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/) and and [Mindbox Studios](https://mindboxstudios.com/).
