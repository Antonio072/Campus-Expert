# Definition:
   __Current__
   * My community encompasses of students who are learning and succeeding at computer science and engineering , but have less exposure in technology due to the system of education in my country, in my school students have less exposure to practical application of what they are studying and this makes them to feel left out in the world of technology. These people are open minded and ready to explore technology and also to use it to solve real life problems. 
   __ideal__
   * we organize weekly meetups where we talk about tech, open source and also discuss about how to get tech into other fields.
   
  # Accessibility:
  * Our Tech hub is not really accessible to our students because of lack of technical skills which i am trying to solve, i organize code class every wednesday and friday which sometimes won't hold due to unavailiablity of venue(we mostly use lecture hall).I basically teach students web development and software agile development.
  # Interests:
  * My community is not only for computer science , we have people from engineering, thou i'm not okay with it , i look forward to onboarding students from other fields in our community beacuse we have interests in integrating tech into other fields.
  # Goals:
  * People get involved in my community because we provide them with opportunities , give them real time information and also support them both technically, career wise and in decision making.
  * There are students from other fields that picked interest in technology regardless of their major, we currently have one student from Agriculture that wants to use tech to rebuild Agriculture, she is currenlty enrolled in our web development class.
  *  Some of our memebers have gotten internship offers through the opportunities we provide.
  * I am working towards addressing imposter syndrome because it is really a barrier, especially to women.
  # Location:
  * We celebreate every new member that joins us, we also have slack bots that welcome them privately.
