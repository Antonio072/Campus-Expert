# About Kokul

Hey everyone! 

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My technical interests inlude web development, graphic design, security, and AI. Outside of tech I love listening to music (I'm a huge hip-hop nerd), learning useless (albeit interesting) things, and having open discussions about a wide range of subjects. I'm looking forward to meeting all of you, and if you want to get in touch, shoot me an email at <ksubendr@edu.uwaterloo.ca>  :smile:

Lastly and most importantly, this is my favourite emoji: :sunglasses:
