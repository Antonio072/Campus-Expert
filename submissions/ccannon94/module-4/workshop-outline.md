  - Presentations
  - Documents
- Storage sharing services allow collaboration, without accountability and management
- Separate project management solutions are available, but add friction
- **interaction question:** what kinds of software have you tried to use for projects
in the past? What did or didn't work with them?
- GitHub provides collaboration, management all in one place
- We should manage things like the professionals we are training to be
