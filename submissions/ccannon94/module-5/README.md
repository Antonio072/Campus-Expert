# Welcome to COMP-167
Computer Program Design

## Course Content
In this course we will explore the fundamentals of object-oriented programming
through Java application development. Additionally, in the lab we will focus on
learning practical tools such as git for source control and GitHub for remote
repository hosting and code review!

## Purpose
This repository will hold resources for the class as they become available. Currently,
the introductory slideshow is available [here](https://github.com/NCAndTCS/COMP167-Class-Resources/blob/master/COMP167GitIntro.pdf).
Students are encouraged to suggest additions to these resources as they see fit
through a fork. Instructions for forking a repository can be found in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/2d69b4c988f1298ebeb1a0873c7685f9).

## Gists
Every good remote repository hosting service has some method of maintaining a base
of knowledge. This allows developers to document processes in an effective, source
controlled manner. On GitHub, one way that knowledge can be maintained is through
Gists. The following is a list of Gists prepared for this class:
  - [Forking](https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/2d69b4c988f1298ebeb1a0873c7685f9)
  - [Git for Major Programming Assignments](https://gist.github.com/ccannon94/511115be821a873ae9ec5f4db9cfdda0)
