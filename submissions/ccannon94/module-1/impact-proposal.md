Now that you've [thought about your community's needs](community-assessment.md), it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make a :sparkles: impact on your community.

## Summary of the Community's Needs

My community needs to grow the amount of people that participate in
learning new technologies together. We finally, for the first time in
years, have the space, resources, and core group to bring quality
programming to our campus, now we need to bring students in and grow
together. In order to facilitate this, the charter must be completed in
such a way that the existing students need not feel threatened as new
members join us and make our community their own.

## Your Proposal

During the Campus Experts program, my number one goal is to build a self-sustaining community of engineering students who are proficient enough in git, GitHub, and
collaboration that they can sustain the progress that our CS department has made moving forward. I returned from an outstanding internship in the Spring of 2017 with
a mission to bring git and collaboration to my university's CS curriculum. Previously, no class used git as a primary teaching tool. With the support of one of the CS
professors and GitHub Classroom, I led the effort to integrate git and GitHub into the 2nd CS course in our course progression, exposing students to it early so they
could use it in following classes. Thanks to the community that is growing as a result of the MakerSpace and Robotics Club, I will now have the opportunity to go even
further in depth with students, to grow a level of proficiency that can sustain the GitHub Classroom effort going forward. Primarily, this means students gaining
enough proficiency that they can teach complex operations like merge conflict resolution and manage large repositories, well after I graduate in the May 2019.

### Key Program Points

#### Pop-Up Class
Pop up classes will be hosted in conjunction with the Robotics Club and MakerSpace. These organizations are entrusted by the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering with the operation of such classes, and have access to resources such as rooms and refreshments sponsorship that will make the events much easier to
manage. These classes will follow a "traditional" workshops approach, with a presentation made by me and certain exercises for the students to follow along with.
There will also be a much more informal question and answer period as well as an open discussion time when refreshments are served.

#### Open Lab
Open Labs will again be hosted in conjunction with the Robotics Club and MakerSpace, but will take place without a structured presentation and will involve more
one on one time with attendees. These will all be hosted in computer labs on campus and students can receive help on whatever tasks they need, generally related
to the overall topic. There will also be exercises available for students who want to test their skills while assistance is readily available.

## Your Proposal's Impact

My immediate intended audience is the computer science and computer engineering students at NC A&T, while being deliberately welcoming to students from any major
with an interest in software development. Specifically, I want to provide a community that, in addition to the other aims of the MakerSpace and Robotics Club, is
passionate about source control, open source, and collaboration.

Thanks to the support of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, I have access to all the resources I need to begin building this community. We have
the communication pipeline, the labs, and the student leaders to support this effort.

Thanks to my experience at my internships and implementing GitHub Classroom into the COMP 167 curriculum, I have the domain knowledge about the use of git and GitHub
in nearly every use case that I can currently _foresee_. However, because the possibilities of GitHub's collaborative tools are near limitless, I will find
resources through the GitHub Campus Expert program to support the outside-the-box use cases I hope to foster the growth of.

I plan to finish this training by September, and host the first "pop-up classes" beginning mid-September, when the MakerSpace and Robotics Club start their series. By
December, I will have presented at least 4 workshops covering basics to advanced usage of GitHub. I will also support the ACM hosted Hackathon at the end of
September.

## Planning for the Future

I plan to complete a full series of events by December. I will collect feedback from each event, consolidate that feedback, and evaluate the state of my project over the winter holiday. I will make necessary adjustments before the start of the Spring semester. During the Spring semester, I would like to both restart at the basics for those who need a refresher or would like to start for the first time, and I will also dive deeper into advanced topics with those interested. I will know my project is successful if I see students using GitHub for software projects where it is not required, if there is a strong enough community to sustain advanced, in depth work in the January, and if the community has developed enough that other students offer to help when new students begin learning with us.
