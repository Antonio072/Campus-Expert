## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics during module 1 webinars, which you can find in the README.md for this module. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

### Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:
  - Women that use Linux
  - Girls learning how to code
  - Students interested in tech in the Central Florida region
  - Computer Science teachers in the Orange County school district
  - Online computer programming professors
  - Hackers in and around London

  My community consists of engineering students at North Carolina A&T State University who attend "pop-up classes" hosted by the
  Robotics Club in conjunction with the Aggie MakerSpace. NC A&T is a historically black college, so the community consists primarily
  of students of color.

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?

  My community includes a 15 student core group that manage the Robotics Club and the MakerSpace. Around 30-40 people will attend events
  regularly. In an engineering school of a couple of thousand, I would like to grow the group to at least a hundred or so people who
  learn and grow together. In the past several years, this community had begun to fizzle out at my school. Last academic year, a
  renewed interest in the Robotics Club and new support from the school to provide a MakerSpace with material support, caused the
  community to grow greatly! There are now two dedicated spaces and access to additional classroom spaces as needed for my community.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?

  There are multiple organizations on my campus that provide opportunities to learn about tech. From the basic classes, to advanced
  research project teams, and many spaces in between. Currently, I am on the executive board of the ACM chapter at my school which is
  planning our inaugural annual hackathon this year. Additionally, I am a software lead on the Autodrive Challenge Team, working to
  develop an autonomous vehicle with support from General Motors and SAE. There are many such opportunities to apply knowledge, but
  the biggest thing missing is the _intermediate practical skills_ that prepare students to work on such advanced projects.

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
- Is there childcare available?

  Specifically for the MakerSpace community, our workstations are not very accessible for those with special physical needs. While
  the facility is fully accessible, our actual workstations are not. Meetings are held at varying hours, during lunch hours during the
  school day or after hours in the evening, so most schedules should be able to find a time to work. We try to offer as large a variety
  of time slots as the school schedule allows.

  Child care is available through the university during normal school hours, but not during our after hours sessions.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?

  The community is open to any student on campus, and we have a mandate from our faculty benefactors to specifically target
  engineering students. I like the mandate that we are issued, because the funding for our operations comes from the Department of
  Electrical and Computer Engineering, so it is necessary that our programs _specifically_ target the needs of these students. Our
  board is required to be made up of students from within the department where our funding derives. However, our faculty adviser agrees
  completely that we have a responsibility to use our unique resources to allow opportunities to as many students from campus as possible,
  to enrich not only our own activities, but the university as a whole.

  The topics our community cover are totally open ended. While we tend to cover topics including software development and, in addition to
  that, the hardware that we have available as a MakerSpace (3D printer, CNC, etc), we take suggestions from the community and will host
  sessions on _any_ topic that we can **make** something from. Our more diverse topics include audio/video editing, professional branding,
  and organizational leadership tactics.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?

  People get involved in my community to learn the skills that aren't taught in classes that allow them to apply their knowledge and
  _make things happen_. My community is student-led and for students. A primary goal instilled in us by our faculty adviser is to provide
  creative outlets and practical uses of engineering skills that will help retain students in the engineering program and produce a
  more experienced crop of engineers for the work force.

  Some of our students are passionate about software development, and others strictly hardware. We try to allow both groups to
  pursue their interests by collaborating on projects that require _both_ skillsets to be successful.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

  My community has 2 dedicated spaces in the college of engineering and has access to other classroom or lab spaces as needed. All of
  these spaces are free for us to use and all students can easily access it.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

  My community utilizes GroupMe to communicate amongst ourselves. Additionally, we utilize GitHub to store everything from our
  organizational documents to our software projects. We need to better utilize campus communication including mass emails, announcement
  boards, and other methods to reach more students that will grow our community.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
- How will you personally handle it?

  My community is extremely welcoming to new people, but not very open to ideas that may change how we operate. I think this part of our
  culture is rooted in recent experiences. Most of us watched the previous board of this organization "improve" the club by eliminating
  rules, roles, regular meetings, to encourage "freedom" for the members, which essentially meant alleviating the board of their
  responsibilites. We watched these changes destroy our club, and we are working to rebuild it. I am trying to relieve these concerns by
  codifying the expectations of our club as far as organization, conduct, and responsibilities in our charter (hosted on GitHub), so
  we can be freely accepting of new ideas because we have a foundation through which to approach them.
