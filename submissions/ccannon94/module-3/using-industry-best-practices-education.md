# Using Industry Best Practices in Computer Science Education
A proposed talk by Chris Cannon

## Intended Audience
The intended audience for this talk is CS or other technical educators seeking
strategies that will give their students an edge in the workforce.

## Abstract
Technical educators are tasked with equipping the engineers, developers, and
leaders who will solve the problems faced by generations to come. With this
responsibility in mind, it is absolutely essential that we make the most of the
short time we have with our students. Often, in modern technical education,
students will be receive a solid introduction to the concepts of the topics
covered, without ever solving a problem fully, as they will be tasked with in
the workplace. This skill gap leaves students of good, dedicated teachers, just
short of fully equipped to step into their roles in the workforce.

Therefore, I intend to propose a teaching paradigm that places emphasis on
learning vital foundations of computer science through the best practices
used in the industry. Evaluating problems, specifying a solution, and
implementing that solution in a version controlled, continuously integrated
environment will allow students to understand the power of these tools as they
learn the power of computer science. I will propose workflows manageable for
every experience level, and solutions that any secondary or undergraduate
technical educator can adopt.

Primarily, I will use git, GitHub, Travis-CI, and StarUML as example methods
for bringing these solutions to classrooms. For example:
- Stipulate that a mechanical engineering professor wants to issue a group
project where students are tasked with developing a specification for a part.
This group project will be revised as the semester progresses, and additional
"issues" of the specification will be completed as the students learn.
Demonstrate the difference in collaborating multiple releases of a text-based
file on GitHub, versus making multiple copies on Google Drive, DropBox, or
local solutions.
- Illustrate a CS classroom where professors grade programs by hand, or, by
an automated testing framework that does not provide feedback to students.
Contrast this illustration with a Travis-CI server that provides immediate
build and testing framework in a pull request. Note that the emphasis is now on
student success, and using the tools available in the industry to facilitate
this success, than on student failures only pointed out after the due date.
- Contrast hand-drawn student UML diagrams with specifications from major
companies. Note that teaching students to produce _almost industry-quality_
work enables them to _almost succeed_ in the workforce. Contrast student-
developed StarUML diagrams with industry specifications and note the
similarities in quality.
