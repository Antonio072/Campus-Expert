# Using Industry Best Practices in Computer Science Education
A proposed talk by Chris Cannon

## Intended Audience
The intended audience for this talk is CS or other technical educators seeking
strategies that will give their students an edge in the workforce.

## Abstract
Technical educators are tasked with equipping the engineers, developers, and
leaders who will solve the problems faced by generations to come. With this
responsibility in mind, it is absolutely essential that we make the most of the
short time we have with our students. Often, in modern technical education,
students will be receive a solid introduction to the concepts of the topics
covered, without ever solving a problem fully, as they will be tasked with in
the workplace. This skill gap leaves students of good, dedicated teachers, just
short of fully equipped to step into their roles in the workforce.

Therefore, I intend to propose a teaching paradigm that places emphasis on
learning vital foundations of computer science through the best practices
used in the industry. Evaluating problems, specifying a solution, and
implementing that solution in a version controlled, continuously integrated
environment will allow students to understand the power of these tools as they
learn the power of computer science. I will propose workflows manageable for
every experience level, and solutions that any secondary or undergraduate
technical educator can adopt.

Primarily, I will use git, GitHub, Travis-CI, and StarUML as example methods
for bringing these solutions to classrooms.
