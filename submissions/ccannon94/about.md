Hello my fellow trainees!
My name is Chris, and I study computer engineer at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, North Carolina!
I am a senior by credits, but I have 2 years left still until graduation (Fall 2019). On campus, I am involved in multiple
communities. I am on the executive board of the ACM chapter at NCAT, as well as president of our robotics club. I am a superuser of
our MakerSpace, and an undergraduate TA for the Computer Science department. My favorite emoji is definitely :+1:, its my go-to response
to pretty much everything! I am totally dedicated to the ideals of open source, collaboration, and sensible code management, and I look
forward to being an advocate for all of these things as a GitHub Campus Expert!
