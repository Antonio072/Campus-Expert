Hi everyone, my name is John!

I'm currently studing CS and Math at Vanderbilt University where I am also involved with several of the CS organizations such as VandyHacks, our collegiate hackathon and VandyApps where we teach students CS topics not typically covered in the classroom. Outside of CS, I'm a passionate runner and triathlete, which is where most of my free time goes. Other than that I like to play allmost any competitve game/sport with my friends and I often get very competitive. And last but not least my favorite emoji is: :fire:
