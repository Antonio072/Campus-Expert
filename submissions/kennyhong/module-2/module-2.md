Module 2 - Case Study
=====================

# Background

At my school, we have an active collegiate community for a specific online game. Often, we apply and receive swag and goodies from the company to distribute to fellow members of this student community within the University. The swag is delivered to one of the executives of the student group and is brought to the club room immediately. We have a list of what we received and plan the event accordingly so that everyone gets something.

# Nature of the Incident

The executive who received our first ever shipment is an active member of another group of the game which is not affliated with the university student group. He decided to open the shipment, take some swag and distribute it within his non-affliated group and gave some of the swag away as 'owing favors to friends'. This swag was supposed to be used to encourage membership and recruit new members to the collegiate group within the university. The incident came to light when the box was dropped off open and when we did the inventory, the numbers did not match up with what we requested or what was written down. The person who took the swag did not ask the other members of the executive, it was just taken, and we were confused why there was quite the difference in missing items. 

We had originally brushed it off as a shipping error and adjusted our recruitment plans, but a few days later, a member of both communities came into our club room to thank us for the cool lanyard. We were confused about and asked him what he was talking about. He explained that one of the executives was handing out the lanyards to random people at an event not affliated with our group. 

# Reactions

Shocked, we quickly set up a meeting and discussed the reason why he took the swag for the students from the group. We wanted to keep the situation controlled, so we sat down and tried to resolve the issue. 

# Topics Discussed and Moderation Action

* This incident was a precedent for a new process for receiving items. We wanted him to explain why items were taken without anyone knowning and what we can do to prevent this situation from happening again. 

* Trust was broken between him and his fellow executive members. How were we able to trust him again?

* This can affects the group's image, if someone were to find out that an important person of the group was taking and distributing items without asking.

* We asked him to return the rest of the items taken and developed a new inventory system for the club.

* We didn't want this to affect the community negatively and forgiveness is important for a positive outcome. He was a huge part in the planning of events and a well known player of the game and we didn't want to start a bigger situation outside our community. We decided as a group to give the person another chance.

# Outcome

A year later, the inventory system is still going strong. All new shipments must be dropped sealed by the executive, due to the design of the box, any tampering is very noticable and will be noted. The box is opened during a meeting and gets counted and added into the inventory on the spot. Any extra swag left over from events gets used in the next event and stored in a locker where it gets counted each week and only two people have the key to the items. With constant monitoring and frequent events, we never had another incident. The group was happy with this outcome and I was happy this did not escalate any further.

# What could be different?

There could have been a negative outcome to this situation if we had taken a different path for the final decision. This also would not have happened if we had figured out an inventory system prior to applying for the swag. We didn't think we'd get into a situation where the honour system was broken by someone we trusted, but I believe that we did the correct thing.
