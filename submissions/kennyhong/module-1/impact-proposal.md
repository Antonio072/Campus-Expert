Impact Proposal
===============

# Summary

## Community Demographics

From first years to veterans in the degree, this group is open to anyone with an interest to learn in a collaborative setting. This group is not restricted to just Computer Science students, anyone who is interested and has a drive to enhance their learning in tech is welcome. The current iteration of the group ranges from second years to final years but they are planning a hard drive for first years this upcoming term.

## Communication

We are currently communicating over an active Slack community for the student group and it seems to work. Events are created on Facebook and shared on Slack. This is already used regularly by many students and it will only grow.

## Culture

.devClub is now lead by 2 great leaders who have assembled an active team to help them manage and plan .devClub meetings and events. Currently, the club is in its stages of expanding the community by planning to participate in the different orientation week activities to recruit new members. University is an adventure and .devClub strives to create a community that will let students enjoy (or stress about) the adventure together.

The Proposal
============

During the Campus Experts program, I hope to use what I learn to build on the current community and help it grow. I've looked into the different modules created by this program, and I believe that this is a great opportunity to learn a wealth of information and bring it back to the growing community. My role as an advisor to devClub is not to dictate what ideas should be implemented or organized. I will be there to help them grow their ideas and do everything within my power to help in the organization of the event they have in mind or the implementation of a new project that they want to start. On the side, I am able to organize events such as workshops and speakers to help supplement this community as well. To summarize the goals in the community assessment, we want students to learn what is in the world of technology outside of academia, but we want to expose this in a fun and engaging way. My proposal addresses these goals by gaining the knowledge to help the organizers plan and execute events without a hitch. Communication has already been established with the group. I want to provide support to this group in any way so that it grows and sets a precedent for the future iterations to come.

Some modules I am looking to finish are:

* Module 2: Community Management -> Estimated Due Date: September 3rd

* Module 6: Fundraising -> Estimated Due Date: September 6th

* Module 5: Technical Writing -> Estimated Due Date: September 10th

* Module 3: Public Speaking -> Estimated Due Date: September 10th

This can be expanded for the future.

Proposal's Impact
=================

## Target Audience

Although this is targeted to Computer Science students, anyone who has an interest in technology and development can participate.

## Community Needs

The growth of the community hangs at times, and some members become inactive during these times. I want to help create events that are engaging increase the presence of this community and reduce the number of inactive members.

## Resources

Like stated in the community assessment, materials online are in abundance and accessible by almost everyone. There are a few events that a lot of members are interested in that require hardware that the group does not have funding to get. To remedy this issue, we will be looking at different methods of fundraising this year and try to raise enough funds for some hardware.

## Content Knowledge

Being a veteran at the University of Manitoba, I know the ins and outs of organizing events. From big 'Frosh Festivals' with big name artists like Childish Gambino and Chromeo to TEDx events, I've done it all. If I ever need help with the logistical side of event planning at the University of Manitoba, I know who to contact.

## Proposed Timeline

### Community Timeline:

_Late August - Early September_: Help plan for orientation week -> recruit new members. Have an early event.

_Late September - Early October_: Propose a meeting with the executives of the club and guide a brainstorming session on events and ideas to aid in the growth of the community.

_Mid October - Late October_: Develop and check the feasibility of the ideas.

_November - June_: Execute/implements the ideas and repeat the steps for the next term.

### My Timeline: 

_Now - Early September_: Work with .devClub to plan for recruitment.

_Late September - Early October_: Assess the needs after recruitment and guide the ideation based on what the needs of the group at the time.

_Mid October - Late October_: Help the group gauge the feasibility of the decided upon ideas and start the planning of them.

_November - June_: Execute ideas and re-ideate/reassess the situation if needed and continue on to the next event.

Planning for the Future
=======================

At the end of each term, I will review and evaluate myself. Based on the proposal I will measure success based on the following factors:

1. What were the strong points of this term?

2. What were the weak points of this term?

3. Recruitment vs. Active Members vs. Inactive Members

4. Was I helpful in the growth of this community?

5. Was the goal of growing the community met this term?

6. Was I able to develop myself as well as others?

7. Were there any precedents set to make obstacles simple and fast to overcome?

I will also be sending a survey to the organizers with the same questions to help me improve for the next term. The community plans will be reassessed at the end of each term.
