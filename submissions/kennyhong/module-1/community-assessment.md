A Community for UManitoba
=========================

## Definition

Back in 2015, I officially created a student community called .devClub. The mandate of this community is to provide an educational and collaborative setting for students interested in learning different technologies outside of their courses. This is not a 'hacker' group. This is a group with a broad definition that does not restrict the student group to a single topic.

## Size

There is currently 20+ active members of this student group with around 10 members who are part-time members depending on their co-op streams. However, for events such as Local Hack Day and networking opportunities, there can be upwards to about 100 attendees. .devClub's core members that come to the weekly meetings and actively participate as well as volunteer are essential in the success of the bigger events mentioned. There is always room for the bigger events to grow, weekly meetups with 20-30 people is a decent turn out for a medium size school like the University of Manitoba. We will never close our doors to new members. If the size of the student increases, we will only adapt and grow together as a community.

Where we can improve:

* Although online resources such as courses on Youtube are abundant, resources such as hardware required to hold a workshop that a good amount of students are interested in (ie. Arduinos, Pis, etc...) can be scarce and hard to find.

* Public speaking is hard for a good chunk of students; the meetings are borderline too big at times for someone who is relatively new to presentations to comfortably speak in front of 20-30 eyes staring at them.

* Sizes are volatile due to the various subject changes every few weeks. Some are interested in one topic more than others. On top of regular academia, some attendees of this group pick and choose the meetings they go to base on the topic which is released on Slack prior to the meetings for members to prepare. One cannot find a topic that interests 100% of the crowd but we are open to the idea on how to get uninterested parties to at least try. 

## Resources

There are a TON of resources out on the internet. Students have access to a ton of software as well as online courses. Just recently, the group took advantage of and completed the (Javascript30)[https://javascript30.com/] challenge. Organized by the current leaders of the group, they met every week for a month to talk about their results while working their way through the challenge. We have a dedicated member who always has her eye out for amazing free courses on Udemy and pings whenever there is a sale. Finally, the last thing I did before I passed on the leadership of this club to two very talented individuals, was help the student get an office in the centre of the University Campus. The office will provide a base for office hours, Q&As, and a stress-free area to work out problems. I am now taking on an advisory role within the group as well as being the treasurer of the group.

Where we can improve:

* It took two years of grueling failures and satifying successes for my various members of the community and I to build enough of a presence for this group to get an office for the group. We are now going to start looking at fundraisers focusing on hardware that students are able to borrow and use it for educational purposes. These are not currently documented, but I do plan and have started writing a series of blog posts on my observations with starting a student community.

## Accessibility 

Resources are online and accessible by anyone with an internet connection. Meetings times are decided each term and chosen based on the best available time for as many people as possible via Doodlepolls before the start of a new term. If one misses the meeting, they are able to catch up using the carefully written minutes posted on our communication channels. Most meetings are in the evening and the current leadership is testing the possibility of live streaming every meeting. We also have a member of is an active member of the Accessibilities community to guide us in discussions of accessibility within the community. 

Where we can improve:

* With a big group, not everyone can be satisfied with the time of meetings. With that being said, meetings are just a small part of this community. The main focus is to create a network of students within the University. We want to however, experiment and find effective mediums to give this community the full .devClub experience. We are current facilitating discussions and increasing activity using Slack. Every member who joins the group has access to this Slack and it is straight forward to use. It has been super effective thus far, and we hope to grow this network.

## Interests

Although this group is composed mostly of full time Computer Science students, however, we have active members in programs ranging from business to design from a different post-secondary institution. The group is open to all ideas from every member, as well as giving them a chance to present and discuss their idea within the meeting. 

# Goals 

The main goal of this group was to create a community of students who are comfortable enough with each other to share ideas, network, participate in discussions, and overall, learn from each other. To encourage the friendship, the group normally goes out for post-meeting wings/bubble tea/drinks to get to know each other. We also hold team building and networking events that does not necessarily pertain to Computer Science such as potlucks, holiday get togethers, and other fun activities. Students who are active in .devClub have created amazing projects and comfortably presented as well.

# Location

We hold our meetings in various classrooms in UManitoba's engineering building. This building is very accessible, with free parking spots after 4:30 PM, and there is a public transit hub right beside it. The classroom is free to use for Student Union approved student groups and most of the classrooms are well equipped with the latest projection technologies. The size of the classroom varies, but there are always more than enough spots for members to join in. Unfortunately, as a student group with no funding, we cannot provide weekly meetings with refreshments, however there are water fountains and many places to get snacks nearby.

Where we can improve:

* The university is not the best with room bookings, with our rooms at times being double booked or we never get a reply. I hope to work with the faculty of Engineering to try and remedy this issue, possibly set up a meeting.

# Communication

Our entire student group is on a Slack community where we post the latest meeting minutes, announcements, and information about upcoming events. It is also a means of communicating and having online discussions. Subgroups form out of this Slack such as the Leetcode competition group that go online every Saturday to participate in the Leetcode events. Having a single point of contact is nice, we've tried Facebook groups and the CommunityLink software the school provides but our success comes from our Slack community.

The most effective mean of communication is Slack. The slack is fairly active during the school year. Initially bringing a group of students to slack is hard, but with a core group of active members, I hypothesize that the FOMO (Fear of missing out) Syndrome might be a factor in the active community. :P Something new this year is that the club now has it's own office, so we are excited to see how we can leverage that!

# Culture

This is the best part of .devClub. The group consists of like-minded peers who are always ready to share, listen, and discuss. Everyone is welcoming to the community, and every time we get a new member, they are friendly and inviting. If there is ever a disagreement during a meeting, which do happen, it sparks a discussion, but it always ends in a resolution. Over the past two years, there has never been a disagreement so serious, that it required a mediator. Should there be a situation, our student union has a student services representative that is always available to help. We are fortunate to have a group that works well together and there are also student executives in the group with office hours that are well equipped to listen and help mediate situations if needed. This group is by no means a community of hardcore hackers, but more of a community of students with similar interests working together to complete projects, learn, and create lifelong friendships.

### Code of Conduct

There is a Code of Conduct/Constitution/Bylaws document that was created when the group was created as one of the requirements. These outline anything related to policy as well as the code of conduct. It is accessible through the group's page, but a more updated version is in the works with the new leadership. I would love to help out with that part as well.

Where we can improve:

* Like most communities, when a subgroup of people become very acquainted with each other, they become a clique. Although this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it may be more intimidating to new members. Luckily, our members are very welcoming and we hope that everyone feels welcomed in this community.

* Most students who have joined have became more active in discussions and activities. However there are still a few students that don't quite feel comfortable yet.

* We are always trying to improve the inclusiveness of the group reaching out to students from across campus.
