## About Me 👩🏽‍💻

**Name**: Aida El Kouri

**School**: University of South Carolina (🐔)

**Year**: Junior

**Major**: Computer Science



### Coding Experience / Interests

<u>Experiences:</u>

- **Full stack web development:** During my last internship, I gained valuable experience in full stack web development to make progressive web apps. I used `React.js` with `Redux` and `Java` to create REST APIs that could allow for more interactive, yet data driven web experiences.
- **Java for IVR Systems**: During my current internship, I am using `Java` in a really interesting way to create IVR systems (something most people haven't heard of). IVR systems are the technology that allows for complex phone dialing systems (i.e: press 1 for this, press 2 for this). We use `Orchestration Designer` along with basic `Java` to create these complex phone systems.
- **Data Cleaning/Text Mining**: For the first two years of my undergraduate degree, I had a heavy focus in data science research: particularly how we can use natural language processing to extract meaning from a large dataset of documents without losing the original essence of the text. 

<u>Interests:</u>

- **Open Source**: For a long time, I have been really interested in open source development. The learning curve is somewhat steep, but I'm hoping that familiarizing myself with Github is just the first step in developing my skills.
- **Julia**: I have recently discovered the wonderfully simple yet powerful language `Julia`. I am currently trying to contribute to their open source project.



### Anyhoo..

So if you're tired of hearing about tech stuff, lemme explain a little bit more about who I really am. I was born in Casablanca, but moved to South Carolina when I was but a wee girl. I love love love true crime and any and all documentaries 🎥. I also love Adult Swim and cartoons in general. My favorite foods are...wait this is way too hard to decide. I love sushi 🍣, spaghetti 🍝, spinich dip 🍲, chicken 🍗, the list could go on forever. I am also co-president of Women in Computing at USC 👭 and am super excited to start my Github student journey!!
