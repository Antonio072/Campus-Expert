## Making your first commit to an open source project

## Abstract
Contributing to open source is often portrayed as something only expert programmers or hobbyist can do. Do you need
to be Linus Torvalds to contribute to an open source project? Hell, no. What if I told you that contributing to an open 
source project could be as easy as writing the classical hello world program in any language. Maybe people make this 
stuff a big deal because it gives you a head start on a job or internship application. Guess what? 
You will be guided and you will make your first commit to an open source project. 

You are required to be at least a beginner at a certain programming language(anyone of your choice) and to able able to initialize 
a repository, create branches, commits, merges, forks and push a repository to github.

## Description
This is a hands-on session, so make sure you come with your laptop! You will learn the different ways you can contribute to an open 
source project. Secondly, you will learn which projects are welcoming of first timers. You will also learn about the importance and 
benefits of contributing to open sources project through one or two stories of students who are active contributors to open source projects. 

During the hands-on session, you will choose a project you want to contribute to, based on which area of technology or computer science you 
are interested in. You will fork this repository, download the software or access it online to get familiar with it. After interacting with 
the software for some minutes you will be asked to find out how to improve the project. That is, how to fix a fault is has or make it better 
some how. If you find out how to improve the project, we will orient you on how to submit a github issue to the project. If you don't find a 
fault in the software, we will show you how to work on one of the project's issues and then submit a pull request to the project. The only pre-requisite 
for this workshop is for you to know how to create a new repository on github, commit to your repository, create new branches and then submit to your github repository.
