## Nature Of the Incident
This case study is from a gaming community. The moderator in this case has to deal with an alleged griefer(a person who harasses or deliberately provokes other players or members in order to spoil their enjoyment). The alleged griefer was identified when the community administrators realized he was using the same IP associated to an account with the following offenses and punishements:

*  A total of 2247 complaints filed against it.
*  Silenced for a total of 9216 hours.
*  3 gameplay suspensions as well as 7 silences(these are for abusive chat and/or spam).
*  Account suspension for "massive griefing". 

## Moderation Action
The moderators banned the disruptive user. Their platform allows them to track users using IP addresses. 
So this alleged disruptive user was signing into his account using an IP address associated to a former disruptive account. 
The moderator could spot this potential abusive user from their IP address. 

## Outcome
The other users who were observing the situation approved the action of the moderator. 
The alleged disriptive user was not happy because according to him he did not do something offensive and the claims against him were not verified. 
The moderator acted responsibly by telling the user he will verify the claims against him to find out if he was guilty, because he did not want good members of the community punished unfairly.
When I think about it, this could be an innocent user using thesame Ip as this abusive user(This can be the case if the abusive user is using thesame WIFI as the innocent user). 
I think the platform should develop a better way to track abusive users. Although, the situation was ambiguous, it created a positive outcome for the community because other users felt happy about the moderator's action.

## What could be different?
I don't think there is something the moderator could do different apart from getting a better way to track their users so that they don't ban good upstanding members of the community unfairly. 
I appreciate the fact that once the moderator realized that the account which had a claim for disruptive gaming was using an IP address associated with the account of a troll(recurrently offensive member), they banned the user.
I also appreciate the fact the moderator said he will verify the innocence of the user given the ambiguous situation.
