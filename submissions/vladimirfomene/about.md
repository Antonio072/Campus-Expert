I'm Vladimir Fomene, a Cameroonian studying computer Science at Ashesi University College, Ghana. I'm part of Google Developers club on my campus.
Many people on my campus are not actively involved in tech communities and I will love to use this platform as an opportunity to introduce people
to more resources and help them discover tech communities they could contribute to. 

## Hobbies
* I'm a foodie
* I like jogging.
