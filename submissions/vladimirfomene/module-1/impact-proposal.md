## Summary of Community Needs

### Community Demographics
My community is made of 10 students who are interested in learning technology. We don't have women in my community.
Everyone in my community has access to laptops and access to the internet. Most people in the community has taken
an introduction into programming class. These students are all university students so they have passed their high school final examinations. They usually attend tutorial sessions on google technologies like android and session to prepare them for technical interviews.

### Communication
People in my community prefer whatsapp for communication because it is instant and internet coverage covers our whole campus. 

### Culture
Our current community is really not open to new ideas because it is ran by three people and they come up with the structure of the whole campus. The community does not have a code of conduct to handle misconduct from community members. Our current culture is more accomodative to people who have a career in technology rather than peope who just interested in tech.

## Your Proposal
 * Timeline:
   - Introduction to contributing to open source technologies. ``November 2017``
   - Hack Ashesi (Hackathon) ``February 2018``


 * Community Demographics:
  Previously we have organized tutorial sessions for the community but many people don't come for these sessions. This time around I will involve other majors on campus apart from CS and Engineering. I will organize a hackathon where people will form multi-disciplinary teams to build the solutions they are passionate about.

 * Goals:
  - Create a more diverse community which is passionate about building solutions during hackathons. 
  - Create an open and safe space where people can contribute their own ideas to shape the community because they feel at home.

 * Communication
  - Create a whatsapp group for the community
  - Meet on a weekly basis to learn new technologies and participate in Hack Ashesi 

## Your Proposal Impact
 * Target Audience
  - Student and lecturers on Ashesi University College campus.
 
 * Community Needs
  - Give people the opportunity to move from concepts taught in class to application.
  - Give people the community to work with each other on projects.
  - Help people to start contributing to open source projects.
 
 * Resources
  - I will need snacks,swags and learning resources for my sessions on introduction to open source and hackathons. I plan to get the snacks from Google developers group and the swags and learning resources from Github.
 
 * Media
  - I will form a team to help me organize the team. I want to use my friends who are part of the Google developers group to help me organize my sessions.
  - I will take the Campus Experts training modules on contributing to open source and organizing development workshop and organizing hackathon and I will invite my team members to do the same.

 * Content Knowledge
  - I have been contributing for the Mifos Initiative via Google Summer of Code and I continue to contribute. 
  - For the hackathon, I will ask the student council who already organizes an Ashesi code fair to help me with that.

 * Timeline
  - Introduction to Open Source - 3hrs to 4hrs
  - Hack Ashesi Hackathon - 12 hours.

## Planning for the future
 * I will always send out a survey after every workshop or hackathons to get people's feedback for future improvement.
 * I will also make sure I introduce other people to the campus expert program so that they can continue growing the community once I graduate.
 * I will measure the hackathon success on attendance, team diversity and solutions developed during the hackathon.
