Hi, I'm Eder Vs. I'm 20 years old, I'm from MÃ©xico City and I'm a student of Computer Science in UNAM.

I'm involved in GDG UNAM community in the Science Faculty here at UNAM. Our main job is to create a
community here because there isn't such thing here in Science Faculty so we want to increase that. We have
imparted some courses about Django and Android to survived in a hackathon as a rookie and we have had
good response. Right now we want to create projects and groups to get the students involved and create
community.

My hobbies are of course Computer Science, Basketball, Music, Roller skating and hang out with my friends;
so let's hang out!
