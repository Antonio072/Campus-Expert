## About Me

Hey everyone! I'm Evan Klein, and I'm a senior at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA studying computer engineering. I'm an organizer for [LehighHacks](http://www.lehighhacks.com/) - Lehigh's hackathon. While I study low-level software in school, I am very passionate about web technologies, specifically Angular and Node. I'm always trying to teach myself new things, and I'm excited to get started as a GitHub Campus Expert!
