## About Me

Hey everyone! I'm Evan Klein, and I'm a senior at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA studying computer engineering. I'm an organizer for [LehighHacks](http://www.lehighhacks.com/) - Lehigh's hackathon. While I study low-level software in school, I am passionate about web technologies, specifically Angular and Node. I'm always trying to teach myself new things, and I'm excited to get started as a GitHub Campus Expert!

## Favorite Emoji ðŸŒ® ðŸŒ® ðŸŒ®
- Tacos are my lifeblood, so naturally the taco emoji takes the crown as my favorite emoji. ðŸŒ®
- My number 2 emoji (although I'm not sure whether this is a *true* emoji or not) has to be Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ because it is the perfect response to any awkward conversation. Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ is without a doubt a go-to emoji.
