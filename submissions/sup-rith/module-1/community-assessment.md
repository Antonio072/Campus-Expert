<h3>Definition</h3> 
Students interested in tech and entrepreneurship in the central Illinois area.
<h3>Size </h3>
Our current community consists of about 100-160 students from all different types of backgrounds and experience levels. I would like this community to grow to about 200-300 people by the time I graduate. Historically, our community has been around the 100 students range and increases every year. 
<h3>Resources </h3>
	There are many events that happen around the area for these students. We have a 24/7 co-working space available to students for being a part of the entrepreneurial club on campus. This space hosts events every Friday, teaching students about startups and the hustle of being an entrepreneur. We also host an annual hackathon that happens at the spring. 
<h3>Accessibility </h3>
	There are many resources available to students, the hard part is just knowing where to find them. To start off, freshman and other underclassmen usually shy away from attending these events because they feel that they don’t have enough of the skills necessary to keep up with the current crowd of organizers. Meetings are usually held on weekdays after 5pm. 

<h3>Interests</h3> 
	The current community consists of many computer science and entrepreneurial students that have a passion for learning and growing the community. We are currently trying to increase involvement by opening these clubs to all IT and Business majors. With the majority of members being computer science majors it is very hard to convince the other clubs to join us in our weekly meetings. We are working on ways to open this environment and create an inclusive community. 
<h3>Goals</h3> 
	After surveying students on why they are in these clubs, the number one answer is to make connections and have a job after graduation.  The majority of the members are undergraduates with a couple grad students in the technology field. With that said many of these students join to get experience, learn real world skills, and meet potential employers. The ideal community that I would like to have is a mix of all majors as well as employers seeking to help students get these jobs. 

<h3>Location</h3> 
	Our location is usually on campus but some clubs use the co working space to meet up. This place is the perfect spot in the center of “uptown” which includes many food places and has lots of people walking in and out the building. This space is provided for free for students in the entrepreneurial club. For others there is a $50/ month fee for students. The space is mostly used for meetups and has monitors for people to connect to. In the front there is a main area often used for speaking in front of a crown and can fit about 50 people in one setting. In the back there is a small kitchen area often used for coffee and snacks. 
<h3>Communication</h3>
	The way many different ways we communicate with each other.  First the leaders of these groups all have a slack channel that post important notifications and things like that. For general members of the community, we used Facebook pages and post important things on there. The last way of communication is we use an email list serve that includes all the emails of students that are in the IT field. 
<h3>Culture </h3>
	Culture is a very important topic in our community. We are very diverse and come from all different parts of the world. We are open to beginners and accept anyone that has a passion for technology and wants to make a difference in the community. When meeting with all these people, there are often many disagreements that happen all the time. The way we go about it is very simple. We have an open discussion where EVERY opinion counts and we take a look at the pros and cons of all possible choices. Next we vote as a group and the majority usually takes the win.
