<h1>Community I do not manage</h1>
<h3>Nature of the incident</h3>
I will be talking about a facebook group I'm in called Hackathon Hackers. This group currently has over 25000 members so naturally there is a lot of conflict. One day I was scrolling through the posts and I saw a post about women in tech and it was about the recent Uber scandal regarding their CEO. First off, I would like to say that the Admins of the group do a great job setting a code of conduct and rules for a post. This post was trending quickly receiving over 200 likes and reactions and over 100 comments. These comments were from people that had something to say about this topic.
<h3>Moderation action</h3>
Conflicts happened because someone didn't agree with what was being said and the situation was soon becoming hostile. The moderators saw this and stepped in. At first they commented on the post and gave their input to the hostility of the situation. The technique the admins used was comparable to Blending as mentioned in Lee Dohms, Community Management repo. The admins first respectfully agree with everyone's opinions. They were essentially trying to bring the hostility down. IT worked for a little while but then things began to get worse. The admins soon realised that people were not being respectful to each other and quickly disabled comments on that specific post.
<h3>Outcome</h3>
The outcome was for the most part a positive for the community. The admins did their job and when things got out of hand, they stepped in and stopped in and ended the burning fire. The community has its hiccups here and there but overall the admins did a great job to keep everything under control.
<h3>What could be different?</h3>
Some ways in which the admins could have intervened is by personally messaging the people that were becoming hostile. I think that instead out having an all out go-at-it type mentality, the admins should encourage a respectful debate. I understand that this is an online community and that it is very difficult to keep things respectful but that is my take on this.

<h1>Community I manage</h1>
<h3>Nature of the incident</h3>
At my campus I manage a small slack channel where we inform our tech community about events, and cool meetups that occur on campus. We had a disagreement over some meetup that is going to happen and it kind of blew up for no reason. People didn't want that meetup to happen and the dates got switched and it was extremely frustrating for the people that want the meetup to happen.  
<h3>Moderation action</h3>
The moderators planned a meeting to occur but no one ended up showing. The debate occurred on the slack channel and everyone was throwing their opinion on what we should do. As a moderator I had the ability to mute people that were in certain channels and things like that. Essentially I created separate channels and waited it out. I waited for the conflict to dim down and then slowly sent messages that hinted to the problem. I think this resembles the Resolution technique in Lee Dohm's Community Resolution Repo. Allowing me to use multiple slack channels helped a lot because people were not talking all the time. The situation because less and less hostile and eventually we came to a resolution. We all had one common goal and there was no point in arguing it out.  
<h3>Outcome</h3>
I think this conflict made our leadership and organizers closer. We never really had many conflicts after this and for the most part everything was smooth.
<h3>What could be different?</h3>
I don't think there was any way in which I could have changed the situation. My best guess would be to try to stop these conflicts from happening by looking at what people are not okay with. If I had done that I think we would have been way better off. After this conflict happened, we take time once a week and write a resolution of things to work on in or slack channel.
