## Summary of the Community's Needs

Kean University is extremely diverse and it is located in an extremely diverse location. The target community ranges from about 400-600 students compared to our current amount who are actually active which is about 20-30 students. The majority of the students in our association are male, and I would like to even out that ratio to 1:1. We need more females in the organization to broaden our ideas and expand our membership. Believe it or not, the number of females majoring in Computer Science has significantly increased in recent years, and I feel they need to be included in such a community. We have made strides towards this in recent years. Last year, the Kean ACM-W (Association for Computing Machinery - Women) was founded whose goal is to include women in our organization. Although our organizations are technically separate, we work as a team to increase our membership and host events. Our community prefers to communicate via online services like Slack or in person in one of our many places to hang out on campus such as the NETLAB. The culture in our community is growing and expanding, we are trying to attract more students to make friends and hang out on campus through organizations like our own.


## Your Proposal

I'm starting this proposal later in the Summer, so I hope to accomplish this by the end of the Fall Semester. My main goal as a Vice President of the ACM would be to increase membership and make this year a memorable, exciting, and prosperous experience for all students involved (including myself). One of my ideas to increase membership is to ask professors in the department if I can come in and speak to the students in their classes for about 5-10 minutes and pitch the organization to them. I feel by coming and speaking to these students face-to-face they will be more likely to join the organization. One of my other plans is really reach out to female students on campus, we really need to diversify the organization as far as gender goes. I also would like to plan more meet-ups outside of general body meetings for students to just hangout, learn, and make friends.

## Your Proposal's Impact

- Target audience
  - I'm expecting to attract students in the Computer Science department at Kean, especially female students, to join our organization and increase membership.
- Community needs
  - Our community is a decent size, but compared to the amount of students who should be in it, it just doesn't add up. If we have 20-30 active students, with at least 481+ students enrolled in our program alone, something is wrong in my opinion and we need to reach out to those students who aren't involved and get them involved.
- Resources
  - We just need time, more money, "swag", and any resources we can get including representatives and speakers from companies who are looking to recruit. We need money to offer our students more things like drone kits, raspberry pis, on-campus free printers, workshops, etc.
  - By any means necessary, that might sound a bit extreme, but to go into more detail, I plan to reach out to companies willing to offer us anything at all, I plan to find any way that we can fundraise some money for the group. Even if we only get a small amount, we can at least afford to buy some snacks and swag for our meetings.
- Media
  - Social media and good old face-to-face communication. Students seem to tend to ignore things that aren't right in front of them, and that's my opinion based on how I used to feel before I joined the organization.
  - Create social media accounts, posters, and prepare what I'm going to say to students who I invite to join.
- Content knowledge
  - I feel that I'm quite knowledgeable considering I've been a part of the organization long enough and I am the Vice President.
  - Not many resources besides my own brain and money provided by myself and the university.
- Timeline
  - I hope to increase membership by at least 10-20 members by the end of the Fall Semester, and by the end of the Spring semester I hope to have increased it by at least 20-30 more. If successful, we should have about 100+ members by the end of the year.

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- I will review it at least twice, at the end of the Fall semester, and the end of the Spring semester.
- If I've gained any members at all, then it is a success to me. If every member counts for at least +1 member the following semester, then even one member is enough of an accomplishment for me.
- As frequently as possible, that's the only way to accomplish them. Keep reviewing your goals, otherwise you'll forget what you're fighting for.
