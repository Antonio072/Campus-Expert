## Assessing Your Community's Needs

Fully understanding the needs of your community is a complex concept that will likely take lots of time, conversation, and observation.  Depending on your situation, you may already have a great idea for what your community needs. You may not, and that's OK. We will go over these questions and topics during module 1 webinars, which you can find in the README.md for this module. Here are some things to keep in mind when assessing your community and hoping to grow it.

Please write down your
- Answers to these questions for current community
- Answers to these questions for **an ideal version** of your current community
- Ideas on how to improve in each category

### Definition
- I would define my community as the Computer Science students at Kean University and the surrounding areas, especially members of the Kean Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

### Size
- There are about 20-30 *active* students in the Kean ACM.
- I would like the entire student body of the Kean University Computer Science Department (about 481 students as of Fall 2016 and growing) to be involved in the Kean ACM.
- I can't accurately answer how large the group has been historically, but as far as I know it's always ranged from 15-30 students who are *active*.

### Resources
- Honestly, not very much, Kean has offered us more over the years, but being a campus and school that is still growing, they can only offer so much.
- Kean ACM has bi-weekly meetups, we seek out companies to visit and talk to us, we attend job fairs as a group, and we host a hack-a-thon each Spring called "HackKean".

  ### Accessibility
- As accessible as they can be, we offer tutoring and we have some resources such as drones, raspberry pis and whatever "swag" we can find from companies, as well as what we can afford to buy with our limited resources.
- We normally host our meetings around 3:15-3:30PM EST, which is college hour to assure nobody has any classes at that time.
- Kean offers childcare to students (and I believe faculty as well).

### Interests
- Our community is generally made up of Computer Science and Information Technology students, which is our goal, however any student is allowed to join.
- As long as those topics relate to "tech" or computers, then yes. Again, we're the Association for Computing Machinery.

### Goals
- Usually, people get involved to make friends and connections within the program.
- Yes, often students hoping to get a degree.
- Yes, I can attest because one of the reasons I joined was in hopes to get a better understanding of applying for internships and jobs.
- I would say that a large majority of them are passionate about developing, but I can't speak for all of them.
- I would like to increase our membership, we have a large program at Kean, and I think that joining our organization can really benefit both the students as individuals and the organization itself. Also, the more students involved in the organization, the more resources we can get from not only Kean, but also companies who visit us and sponsors in general. 

### Location
- On campus, at Kean University.
- We usually meet in one of the CS classrooms on campus, but we also take advantage of online communities like Slack.
- There is free parking for Kean Students.
- There are trollies and busses that run around campus.
- We need permission from University Administration to allow off-campus visittors.
- "Free of charge" to students, if you don't count tuition.
- If necessary, we can move to larger rooms and even lecture halls on campus.
- Our usual room can fit about 40-50 people, but our larger rooms can fit about 100-300 people.
- Our department was just moved to the newest building with the most comfortable seating on campus.
- For general body meetings, we usually order pizza and offer water and other soft drinks.

### Communication
- As stated earlier, we have a Slack.
- We might benefit from further forms of communication, such as updated social media.

### Culture
- Everyone is welcome to speak at our meetings and any and every student is welcome to join.
- We would try to handle it in the calmest way possible. We have yet to have any issues like that so far.
- Our organization has it's own constitution which was adopted from Kean University's Student Organization policies.
- Personally, I would separate the parties involved, talk to them individually, and be a medium to find common ground. Generally, no issue is too large to overcome in these situations, and that's what I always keep in mind.
