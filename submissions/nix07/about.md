## Intruduction
Hi everyone, I am Nikhil Prakash an undergraduate student at RV College of Engineering pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Telecommunication, but I spend most of my time coding!

## About me
I am a self taught computer programmer who loves to code, test, debug and create. I participate in programming contests and practice coding at HackerRank, make small projects and open source contributions at Github, and hack on random stuff. I believe programs can have deep beauty and elegance, just like Bollywood songs!
