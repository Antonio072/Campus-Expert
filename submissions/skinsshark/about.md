ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sharon and I go to the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Engineering but I am currently interning at Apple.
I love tech and art, so I created [sunday desert](http://sundaydesert.tumblr.com/) with my best friend to make art with tech!

ðŸ’® At school, I am a Women in Engineering director + class rep, and in the community a HackerYou mentor and healthy Instagram user

ðŸŽ’ I got my start creating Tumblr themes because it was a perfect combination of my designs + my code giving it life. Fast forwarding to today, with a portfolio mostly in JavaScript => React, Redux + the good ol' Java. Also an enthusiastic visual designer

ðŸ’• There are a lot of things I enjoy. My top in alphabetical order: drinking chai, embroidering my clothes, hiking, photographing with an iPhone, rewatching the Office, soapmaking, swimming, telling my computer to remind me tomorrow

ðŸ¤¡ is a fav emoji because it doesn't render in a lot of places (yet)
