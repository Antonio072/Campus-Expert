Definition:
1. Sudo Hoot is a club of CS students (primarily majors, minors, women taking a CS class, women interested in tech) interested in learning, growing, and supporting each other.

Size:
1. ~140 active members in club
2. ~1500 in college, ~900 at coed consortium school 25-min walk away (10-min bus), ~2000 at coed consortium school a 35-min shuttle ride away
3. When I was a [She++](https://sheplusplus.org) Ambassador, I had more funding to use for events, so that helped increase interest at meetings and online. 

Resources:
1. There's a [blog](http://blog.sudohoot.com/), [website](http://sudohoot.com/), and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SudoHoot/) that includes upcoming events like hackathons and conferences, scholarship information (travel, event tickets, etc), interview preparation, programming resources, and more links and information of that sort.
2. There are office hours, online tools, meetups, and seminars. We bring in external speakers from industry and also host video chats.
3. My tech events newsletter and GitHub repo :D 

Accessibility:
1. Very accessible...the Facebook group is extremely open, supportive, and active. I just wish in-person meetings were the same...they seem too open-ended, so they end up being slow or vague. Also, there's just not as much engagement and conversation there in-person.
2. Meetings are held when some have other club meetings, sport practices, or work.
3. Childcare is not available.

Interests:
1. It's made primarily of CS students, but quite a few non-majors or non-minors. I'm okay with this, as long as it continues to be welcoming to beginners.
2. The community is open to other topics, but there is a lot of direction and guidance needed. When asked, they often don't have a response, so there need to be suggested options.

Goals: 
1. People get involved to learn new skills not taught in class, have mini-study groups, and have more of a support network.
2. These are students hoping to get a degree, which may or may not be CS. (also, \#liberalarts.)
3. Most, if not all, are trying to ramp-up to get a job.
4. I'd like to increase passion for developing. I think there's a greater passion for getting a job.
5. I'd like to set more concrete goals, like "learn to build an iOS app in x-months" or "work with a team of x-other students to contribute to a large OS project."

#Location
1. Community currently gathers in a CS classroom in the science building.
2. There are places where we can meet, but I think the most active discussions happen online.
3. There is free parking :D 
4. There is public transportation available to and from meetups.
5. The location is accessible to those on- and off-campus.
6. The space is free :D 
7. The space is flexible (we get different classrooms based on size or tech reqs.)
8. The largest classroom can fit ~200 I believe.
9. There are different types of chairs for all shapes and sizes.
10. Water and snacks are included :) 

#Communication
1. Facebook and email are the primary forms of communication.
2. There is a Facebook group and email group. I'd like to make a Slack channel and GitHub org. too.
3. I think GitHub would make code more collaborative, and it would help get members more into contributing to open-source and working together.
4. My newsletter-- ~350 subscribers in the Bay Area and NYC. I'd like to add more Philadelphia events, or make a separate one for the Philly-area.
5. [My Bay Area meetups GitHub repo](https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/Bay_Area_tech_meetups) -- I'd like to make one for Philly, and maybe NYC.

#Culture:
1. Unfortunately, sometimes I feel that new people and new ideas can be intimidated. Overall, this is usually not the case, as many try to explain the root cause of intimidation to new members beforehand.
2. If there is a disagreement, club members often talk to some of the club leaders or each other in smaller groups.
3. There are no policies or procedures in place (documented) that I know of. Now that there is more conversation over code of conducts, I'd like to make one or see one made this year.
4. I'd like to stand up more and take on a larger role in my final year of school (I stepped down after one year, during my sophomore year, to focus on other things.) I still contribute to the community, but no longer hold any official position.
