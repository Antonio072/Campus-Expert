# Proposal

## Target Audience
With this event, I am targeting students who are merely interested in working in the tech industry. Technical background would be nice, but unnecessary. As liberal arts college students, we have a variety of skills and backgrounds involving things like communication, writing, and more. This event aims to provide attendees with talks or workshops covering topics like, but not limited to:
1. Potential jobs for CS graduates that are not software engineering.
2. How to tackle imposter syndrome. Right after a semester of struggling through a CS class, I was feeling extremely down. I saw a talk by Gloria Kimbwala on imposter syndrome, and completely changed my perspective. I still struggle, but I persevere, and have a different outlook on the climb and glory of challenges.
3. Technical writing and speaking 
4. Community as a Career
5. Negotiating
6. Creative Coding or Art in Tech
and more!

## Community Needs
Many students feel that software engineering is the only path for them, many experience imposter syndrome, and more. This day of talks and workshops will teach them what is not addressed in classes, or is not necessarily easily accessible online.

## Resources
I need a location (somewhere at my college or one of the colleges in our consortium), online and offline hype and publicity, speakers and workshop leaders (I have some in mind, who could also participate via video), and a small food budget. I will obtain these resources by seeking out college funding or external sponsors I've met at hackathons, conferences, organizing She++ Code Day or Spectra, etc.

## Media
I am preparing to deliver my community impact project by finding some who work in industry and have a personal connection to one of these topics. I could also cover, say, either Community as a Career, Technical Writing or Speaking, or Non-SWE Jobs, as I've either spoken or written about them to some extent. I will make a Facebook event and speak to other club or major department leaders at our consortium schools to gain more interest and help, and utilize email and other forms of social media to publicize.

## Timeline 
Summer: Begin reaching out to alumnae, evangelists, and engineers in Philly and NYC area about coming to campus one weekend afternoon. Reach out to some SF connections about giving a talk remotely. Find sponsors for food, swag, and travel. Get classroom or lecture hall location. 
Fall: Follow up and finalize schedule, speakers, location, dates. 
Winter: Event!
