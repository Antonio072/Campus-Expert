# About Lizzie

Hi! I'm Lizzie, a rising senior studying CS and English at Bryn Mawr College and aspiring developer evangelist. I'm an undergrad CS Teaching Assistant, avid hackathon hacker, conference and meetup speaker/organizer/attendee, organized She++ Code Day, and help organize [Spectra](https://sospectra.com).

## Interests

My tech interests include iOS and web development, but I also dabble in Android, Haskell, and Python. I aim to have the heart of a teacher, mind of a hacker, and soul of an entrepreneur. When I'm not doing tech stuff, I play tennis, ping pong, run, and read. I also maintain a [tech events newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/lizziepika) and a [meetups GitHub repo](https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/Bay_Area_tech_meetups).
