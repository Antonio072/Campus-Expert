<strong><h2>Hi</h2></strong>

My name is Hugo, I am 20 years old, I'm from Mexico City and I currently study Computer Systems Engineering at IPN.

When I heard about this program, I thought to be a great idea to enroll to help build and grow a community here at campus
and encourage students to keep learning. Because we have a large number of quits per year and I want to build a fammily to
reduce this numbe.

My hobbies are: Basketball, Bass, Photography and Hanging out with friends.
