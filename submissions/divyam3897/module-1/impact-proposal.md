## Needs, Proposal, and Impact
###Needs
Our university always have had distributed clubs undergoing different things. I understand that
each one of them has their own needs but it makes it difficult for everyone to manage and maintain all those.
It's a difficult job to find people for each and every club at regular intervals as a result of which the effects
starts fading after a period of time.

###Proposal
I would hold regular weekly discussions in my community with people being a part of the discussion turning up on their own take up a discussion themselves later.

- Timing
I would be starting from the coming week itself "The earlier the better." explaining the motive of the community and making the discussion/sessions a part of their weekly life.

- Community Demographics
I will reach out to people who are involved in various communities to be a part and involve the greater interest of everyone. I plan to start with the CS and IT majors and then
take it to everyone to understand the need of computers and it technologies and hot it has an impact in changing the lifes in future.

I will aim in creating a global club handling all the matters. It would be consisting of volunteers and not members.
Volunteers who can take it forward, who do it because they want to learn and not for any personal benefits. It will not
be restricted to a particular domain but involve all the existing communities to be a part of it. As a result of which
we have an umbrella community handling all the matter to provide a better execution. It would involve a greater involvement as it involves all interests under one hood.

###Impact
- What specific issue are you addressing with your proposal?
I am addressing the issue of bringing students with different interests together to have a greater impact, example it's great if you do machine learning but if
you know web or app development, you get a medium for the representation of your skills of machine learning, if you know optimization and good in competetive prograaming
you work in optimizing it further and form a great combination. So instead of having scattered communities I aim in forming a community which remains together and is
involved in different events conduction.

- What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal?
- How will you obtain these resources?

I just need a room with a projector and people with enthusiasm to learn.
We already have classrooms and lecture halls equipped with them to hold our weekly discussions and sessions.

- How are you preparing to deliver your community impact proposal?
- What are you going to prepare to deliver the content?

I will get in touch with the different communities we have to understand the need of this community. I am going to have a gathering and deliver my motive. I would also
make posts for online social sites to attract greater audience to be a part.

- How knowledgable are you on the topic your community impact proposal focuses on?
- What resources do you have at your disposal to enhance that knowledge?

I have been an open source contributor from more than a year now, being experienced in programs like Season of KDE and Google Summer of Code I am well equipped with the
knowledge of open source and the importance of forming a community and working together. I have also been exposed to various hackathons and also worked in projects in
deep learning. I have been involved in various sessions as a speaker and would be doing the same in future to have a greater impact.

### Timeline
- Work on building a global website handling resources from all clubs.
- Better management of knowledge and resources.
- Forming a slack/telegram group and bridging it with IRC.
- Advertise the community to expand to both CS and Non CS graduates.
- Community involvement of students and assigning mentors to different students for different tasks and projects.
- Have a season of code involving solving of different bugs motivating greater involvement in open surce.

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
- How will you measure success?
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?

I will be involved actively in all the activities held until I graduate and will monitor them efficiently.

Success for me would be joining different genres and volunteering of people that are once a listener of the talks
to take the discussions themselves. It would also involve the participation of non CS majors at a greater level and
interest.

I would itterate every month to review the progress and to take forward the plans after every iteration and make the changes as and when required
to meet the greater goals.
