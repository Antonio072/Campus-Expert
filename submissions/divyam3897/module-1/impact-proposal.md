## Needs, Proposal, and Impact
Our university always have had distributed clubs undergoing different things. I understand that
each one of them has their own needs but it makes it difficult for everyone to manage and maintain all those.
It's a difficult job to find people for each and every club at regular intervals as a result of which the effects
starts fading after a period of time.

I will aim in creating a global club handling all the matters. It would be consisting of volunteers and not members.
Volunteers who can take it forward, who do it because they want to learn and not for any personal benefits. It will not
be restricted to a particular domain but involve all the existing communities to be a part of it. As a result of which
we have an umbrella community handling all the matter to provide a better execution. It would involve a greater involvement as it involves all interests under one hood.

### Timeline
- Work on building a global website handling resources from all clubs.
- Better management of knowledge and resources.
- Forming a slack/telegram group and bridging it with IRC.
- Advertise the community to expand to both CS and Non CS graduates.
- Community involvement of students and assigning mentors to different students for different tasks and projects.
- Have a season of code involving solving of different bugs motivating greater involvement in open surce.

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand beyond this 8-week program. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
- How will you measure success?
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?

I will be involved actively in all the activities held until I graduate and will monitor them efficiently.

Success for me would be joining different genres and volunteering of people that are once a listener of the talks
to take the discussions themselves. It would also involve the participation of non CS majors at a greater level and
interest.

I would itterate every month to review the progress and to take forward the plans after every iteration and make the changes as and when required
to meet the greater goals.
