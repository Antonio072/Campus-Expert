## Assessing Community Needs

### Definition
- How would you define your community?

It's entirely students studying Bachelors of Engineering in Panjab University, India. It's aimed towards all the audience but CS and IT students are the general attendees.

### Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?

Currently, there are around 150+ students who are involved in different activities. I always like to invite and guide as many people as I can by holding regular sessions and discussions.

- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?

It keeps on expanding with the incoming new students and due to the awareness of such events spread in our University.

### Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?

We hold weekly meetups on different topics ranging from Compettive programming, open source, web development, machine learning etc.

We also have yearly and regular evets like:
- [Software Freedom Day](http://softwarefreedomday.in/)
- Software and hardware hackathons

### Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
- Is there childcare available?

Many of our resources are on [PULUG](https://github.com/pulug/), there are many distributed communities in my University handling different tasks, it is one of them :smile:

Meetings are held generally after working hours (5-7) in the evening.

Childcare is not available.

### Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?

It is made mainly of Computer Science and IT students but we try and encourage involment of all the streams including Mechanical, Electronics students to be a part and volunteer fot such events.

Our community covers broad topics and it's not limited to a specific topic. Though we try to cover different topics at regular intervals as and when required.

### Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?

The people involved in community have primarily the following reasons:
- Zeal and enthusiasm to learn.
- A genuine interest to learn new things.
- An interest to volunteer and expand the knowledge of computer science involving more and more people._

We also have many contributors who are not CS Majors but still volunteer due to their interest. I am looking forward to a community who understands the meaning and need
of sharing knowledge and can volunteer to get things done.

### Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

The community gathers in lecture halls where we discuss and hack on various stuff.

There is public transportation available nearby and it's accessible easily to both on and off campus students.

It has a capacity of around 150 students and has a comfortable sitting for all shapes and sizes. There is also canteen and cafe for
water and snacks nearby.

### Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

We have various facebook pages for various events happening like:
- [Codechef Campus chapter](https://www.facebook.com/uietcodechef/)
- [Design and innovation group](https://www.facebook.com/uietdig/)
- [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pulug)

We meet at regular intervals to discuss problems and various topics. The problems and group discussions are often carried out
in the google group along with announcement on the Facebook pages.

### Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
- How will you personally handle it?

We welcome everyone to be a part of our community, volunteer and share your part to expand the horizons of everyone and learn something frome ach other.
