# About Me

Hello! My name is Edan Meyer. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Rochester, double majoring in Computer Science with a focus machine learning and AI and Business with a focus in Entrepreneurship. During my free time I love to work on deep learning and making AI for games. I also do other stuff like wakeboarding and participating in a dance crew.

# Organization

I'm a core organizer for DandyHacks, the University of Rochester's annual hackathon, and also the president of RocHack. RocHack is a club where we aim to teach students more practical and fun programming skills that are often left out in the school's curriculum. We give workshops as well as working on group projects throughout the semester.
