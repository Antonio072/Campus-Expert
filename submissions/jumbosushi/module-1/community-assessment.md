# Community Assessment
This document is assessing [StartupStorm](http://www.startupstorm.org/) community at University of British Columbia (UBC).  
I've been with them for two years followed by one year of break, and I will be back this year :tada:  
The club has been focusing mainly on organizing the hackathon in the past.  
This year will be the first time we focus on building a community  

----

### Definition
#### Currently
Student organization for UBC students interested in programming, startup scene, and hackathons.

#### Ideally
Student organization for students interested in building their ideas into reality with technology.

#### Areas for improvement
I would like to see us moving toward being a community of builders, which doesn't necessary mean people who are interested in entrepreneurship.  
There are already dozens of organization in campus that specialize on entrepreneurship.  
What the campus lack at this point is a hacker club focused on building an actual project that draws a line from tutorials or panel discussions.  

----

### Size
#### Currently
The community is at its early stage. Although there hasn't been a consistent community event, our hackathons over the years has build a steady momentum for people to crave more tech events and communities.

#### Ideally
- Around 20 showing up to our future community event consistently.  
- Around 200 active members on Facebook / slack  

#### Areas for improvement
My goal this year for our community is to build the foundation for the future. The size doesn't have to be big, but what I would like is group of tight-knit active members.  
This would mean members that frequently show up to our events as well as the ones that engage actively on our online spaces.

Another aspect of growth I want to attempt is being in touch with surrounding universities around Vancouver. We have never done anything together due to the distance between schools.  
Since other schools have started to host their own hackathons, joining forces to build a diverse community would be beneficial to all parties.

----

### Resources
#### Currently
Within our schools, knowledge sharing only happens through friend circles.  
Upper level students often succeeded in landing great internship / job, but there has not been a medium to pass down what they have learned in the process.  
What I've also been noticing is the lack of community to share what we've been up to.

#### Ideally  
Ideally the community would have several means of sharing resources:
1. Workshops done by students that are held throughout the year to teach peers about exciting tech.  
2. Lighting talks at casual hack nights where people share the topic presenter is passionate about.  
3. RSS-feed curated newsletter featuring student's blog posts / projects / accomplishments.
4. Links posted by community members on Facebook / Slack to be shared among each other.
Overall I hope to see more horizontal collaboration between students to do a project together.

Ideally the information being shared are somewhere on the line of:
- Upcoming hackathons
- Upcoming career opportunities
- Upcoming events
- Memes :smirk:

----

### Accessibility
#### Currently
While many clubs on campus require membership fee, we have always been able to make it work with sponsorship fund. We hope to keep it this way to encourage anyone to come out without the financial burden.  

UBC Campus does not provide childcare support as far as I know, but have a good handicap infrastructure (many buildings have elevators, hills instead of stairs, etc).  

Meeting are held after school hours on most cases.

#### Ideally
- Build a community guideline for all of our future event  
- Accessibility and inclusive messages are used to communicate on social media promotions.  
- Organization websites are built with accessibility in mind.  
- Share our meeting link with everyone in the community + provide recording afterwards  

----

### Interests
#### Currently
Community members are mainly consist of CS / Engineering students.  
Though we have limited experience in hosting non-hackathon events, from the variety of hacks that student come up with it is clear the students have diverse interests.  

#### Ideally
We welcome students of any background who are interested in tech.  
Many designers come out of Arts program, and business students have started slowly hosting their own technology centred events.  
Hosting beginner friendly event to capture these non-CS demographics would be a good strategy.

#### Areas for improvement
- Prepare a survey after each event to let attendees inform us which topic they would be interested in.

----

### Goals
#### Currently
People get involved with our community to meet like-mined peers. UBC is a campus of 40,000 students, and it is easy to get lost in the crowd.  
This also indicates that we do not get clear idea of what others are up to! Knowing our peers better will lead members to be inspired from each other which is great for the community.  

Students are definitely interested in getting their degrees and preparing for jobs. Events that are on the line of recruiting event or interview practice has had good turnout in the past.

#### Ideally
- Provide space both offline & online to share resources among each other
- Host consistent hack nights with music that lowers the barrier to talk to each other.
- Host a great hacathon as the common thing members can look forward to.

----

### Location
#### Currently
The community lacks both offline & online space where member can interact with each other.

#### Ideally
Online:
- Promote engagement to each others post on social media
- Slack group to talk about whatever community want to discuss
- Safe space for anyone to ask questions

Offline:
- Meetups that will happen on the campus will be accessible from most places with Vancouver's good transportation system.

In terms of buildings, many rooms in CS building provide space for free with presentation setup.  
Specific to CS department, there are range of rooms from smaller ~20 people space to >100 people space.  
Using campus venues for small events are free, but off-campus events will need some form of sponsorship.  

#### Areas for improvement
There is a small deli beside CS building to grab food, but they close early in the afternoon.  
May need to find consistent sponsor to provide snack at our events.

----

### Communication
#### Currently
The communication is very one directional from StartupStorm team to the members in a form of promotion. Not ideal for community building.

#### Ideally
- Communicate across different channels (facebook / twitter / slack / news letter)
- Consistently share projects or blog posts made by members of the community
- Slack would be a great place to host a community that allows everyone to talk to each other.

#### Areas for improvement
On top of starting our online community initiatives, I think it'll be crucial to create a fun, welcoming tone in our online communities.
As it is a new thing for all of us, keeping a light tone will allow more people to be motivated to participate.  

----

### Culture
#### Currently
There has not been much effort to welcome new members in the community. In fact existing members seems to be shy about connecting with each other.

Overall organizations here tend to take a safe bet, and continue the same events over the years.
You'll notice that many clubs does similar events as a result of this campus culture.
This has unfortunately translated to how we did things before which resulted in events like inviting speakers that does not reflect students interests.

We are unprepared to handle any conflicts among members. The way it will be handled will most likely differ depending on who is in control.
If the situation is not minimal, UBC's student union have formal process to handle severe cases of misconduct.

#### Ideally
New members feel welcomed by having events dedicated to new programmers / freshman. In order to sustain this attitude online, there needs to be a culture where people do not belittle each other.

The community will not be afraid to try new event format or new initiatives. This starts by StartupStorm trying out new events.
This also means that we should be welcoming to new ideas that members might bring to us.

Establish a strong community code of conduct will go a long way in creating a positive culture. If any conflict do arise, the organizer will be able to handle the situation based on what is written on conduct.  
It will help people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts / ideas.
