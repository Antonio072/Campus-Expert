## Summary of the Community's Needs

#### Community demographics
The community is UBC students who are interested in building tech projects. This event will specifically target people who are looking for an oppurtunity to contribute to open source projects.  
Students are looking to meet peers who share same interest in tech, and would like to know what kind of projects others has been working on.  
If other schools community organizers are willling to collaborate, students from SFU, UVic, and BCIT will also be part of target community.  

#### Communication
As no existing communication channel has been established yet, we will need to create our own Facebook group & Slack team for this event.  
Inside the UBC campus almost all club events gets shared on faebook, so it would make sense for us to communicate with the community at where they already are.  
Slack might be new to some, but the benefit from community creating on their own sub-community is worth the chance.

#### Culture
This is our first year attempting to create a community, so there is yet to be a defining culture about our early stage community.  
One thing we want to start is to have a strong code of conduct. As the proposed event will take place in Octorber, staring out strong with solid code of conduct will make things easier for us in the future.  

Another aspect of culture that I would like to cultivate is a culture of sharing. For the duration of the proposed event, students will be encouraged to share what they are working on.

### My Proposal: BC Hacktoberfest

**Summary**:  
Every October [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com/) hosts an online event called [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).  
I want StartupStorm to host an event that will ride on Hacktorberfest event specifically targetted for university students in BC (UBC, SFU, UVic, BCIT).  

It will be consist of three parts:   
- **Weekly workshops**: ~20 min workshops focusing on open source (Intro to git, etc)
- **Hack nights**: ~40 hack nights. These will be followed right after the workshop
- **Pull Request Count**: Throughout October, students from participating university will be able to submit their merged pull request to open soure software hosted on Github. Each submission will count toward the sum of total PR submissions per school as a friendly competition.

[**Details are documented on this Google Doc**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hydlbXfqfDI462WjTDSwxq1tmhSfoyiNE5_ZdLNSk8E/edit?usp=sharing)

**Timing**:  
October!

**Community demographics**:  
Anyone interested in open source will be welcomed. Considering how even the most skilled students haven't had the change to contribute to open source yet, this will create an atmosphere where students with various skill are able to meet each other.

This event also aims to increase our community demographic beyond UBC campus. Other schools students will be introduced to our event via participating school's CS clubs' promotions

**Goals**:  
- Build a community that interact with each other through the course of the year
- Provide space both offline & online to find peers that share the same interest
- Empower students to progress their career

**Communication**:  
We will create Facebook Group for this event. This will be a space used by participants to share updates + find each other in real life.  
There will also be a Slack team for this event. This will be a space used by participants to ask questions + find other students interested in the same project among other uses.  
Creating project / language specific channels on Slack will lower the barrier for community members to find others who are interested in the same tech.

## Your Proposal's Impact

**Target audience**  
University students in BC province + students in surrounding universities

**Community needs**  
This event will take place relatively early in the winter term. It creats an oppurtunity for members to find peers who are interested in the same tech as them.  
The communication channels that will be established will be used to share what they have worked on, which satisfy community member's need to know more about what others are working on.  
Even more, the online space can continue to be used to stay in touch with the people that members have met.

**Resources**  
  - Venue, tech talks slides, small sponsorship for food, swag from DO / Github (:heart:), and participation from other schools
  - We have a team of 4 including myself to work on this. We will delegate each other tasks as we go.

**Media**  
  - Promotion of the event will mainly be done on Facebook + Slack
  - To prepare for promotional contents, I will be in close touch with StartupStorm's marketing team.

**Content knowledge**  
  - Couple Pull Requests that I have made in the past has been merged, so I have some real life experience to talk about open soure workflow on Github. 
  - We have contacts of people who are far more active in open soure space than I am on the campus. We will reach out to them if they have any input on the talks that will take place.
  - Aricles are available online to promote open source best practices.

**Timeline**  
  - **Summer**: 
    - Contact other schools for participation
    - Prepare talks
    - Contact DO + local companies for sponsorship to cover food + prize if possible
    - Book the venue
  - **Fall**:
    - Prote the event
    - Confirm with all stakeholders about their role
    - Go with the flow on October

## Planning for the Future

**When will you review the impact of your proposal?**  
Impact of this project will be measured by # of PR's made in October measured by our in-house weba app + post event survey

**How will you measure success?**  
Based on:
- Turnouts and engagement at workshops
- How community interact with each other at hach nights
- Satisfaction level of participants in a survery

**How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?**  
Constantly until October comes around
