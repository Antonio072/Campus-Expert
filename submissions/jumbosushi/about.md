# About me

Hi there :wave:  
I hope to live till 100, wonder how to make my fast eating habit into a career, and like vim a lot.

I'm a 3rd year student studying Business and Computer Science at University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada.  
Born in Japan, lived in US for couple years, and moved to Vancouver for uni all while sipping miso soup for twenty something years.

# Community Involvement
I was previously a [nwHacks](https://www.nwhacks.io/) logistics director.  
This year I will be focusing more on growing the tech community at UBC outside of hackathons.

# Interests

- Running (Outside-than-treadmill kind of guy)
- Making burritos (Ask me about my recipe)
- Web Dev (Ruby :heart:)
- Vim (Love vim-ifying my workflows)
