The mission: 

Aid in the infiltration of Sidney Atanas’ warehouses by determining the warehouse locations from anonymized car data.

Briefing: 

Its long been assumed that Sidney Atanas, technology and retail entrepreneur, has been using various warehouses to shelter and transport illegal and/or ill-gotten goods. Within the last 5 years, Atanas has dramatically upgraded personal and organizational security capabilities globally making him one a few individuals to embark on obtaining such a sizable and highly organized personal security force. While it is currently unknown how much Atanas is spending on his force, some of your fellow agents have watched a unidentified account owned by Atanas’ parent company ballon from $70 million to $40 billion, much of it going to purchases of landing craft and autonomous drones. The agency has reason to believe that these recent developments indicate Atanas is preparing for a full scale attack: potentially to protect his financial interests or acquire more goods.

For many agents, the acquisition of such aircraft signals an imminent threat which is why the agency put together a small task force responsible for identifying some of the vehicles Atanas frequently uses both professionally and personally. Not only did they identify which cars Atanas uses, they were successful in acquiring an anonymized log of all the coming and goings of three cars. 


Your assignment: 

Agent for your first assignment we need you to preform cluster analysis on the car log data to divide the data into groups (clusters) that are meaningful and useful in the search for the locations of the warehouses. In doing so, your analysis will provide the agency an invaluable opportunity to affect the course of events in a illegal market. We are suggesting cluster analysis because it is commonly used to detect patters in spatial distribution of the routes traveled/ starting and ending destinations a vehicle has gone to. Given our desire to establish meaningful groups, the clusters should capture the nature structure of the data (do not manipulate it); thus providing us with a useful starting point for where to send field agents for investigation. It should be noted the algorithm you use for your analysis must have some notion of outliers to ensure there is no problem within the domain of anomaly detection. Consider data point density as your method of find outliers.


Presenting your findings:

When you have completed your analysis, you should create a README to act as your official debriefing report detailing your process and the results.


Creating a debriefing report:

1. Navigate to you fork at random_placeholder_url
2. Create a new branch
3. Navigate to the appropriate assignment number
4. Create a new folder titled your agent name within the assignment
5. Fill the folder your just made with the contents of your debriefing. 
   * README: must include 
      - a description of what cluster analysis is
      - what cluster analysis algorithm you used and a brief description of it
      - visual depiction(s) of the warehouse locations
      - any suggestions you have for the agency about next steps to take regarding the warehouses.
   * CODE: please commit the code you used to do the analysis
6. Commit the file
7. One a pull request on the main repo 
8. Celebrate a job well done.

Getting help with the assignment:

On [insert date], the agency will host a technical workshop will be hosted at [RPI campus location] to further discuss how to conduct a strong analysis. You are also welcome to reach out to me, Director of Intelligence, via email or the issues section of this repo.
