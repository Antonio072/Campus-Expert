# The mission: 

Aid in the infiltration of Sidney Atanas’ warehouses by determining his secret warehouse locations from anonymized car data.

## Briefing:

“Come on in and take a seat.”

You briefly look around the office before taking a seat. The polished hardwood floors are covered it what appears to be a handwoven chevron rug. You think to yourself: “Chevron? Is that what they call it? I mean I rug is just a rug, right? Whatever it’s called it certainly is nice…and expensive.” The walls are covered in cherry wood paneling except for the one behind the Director’s desk; that wall was nothing but glass revealing a detailed view of the entire city. Everything in the room was rich and lavish; each item carefully placed to show the Director’s power. You quickly decided between the couch or the chair opting for the overstuffed brown leather chair in front of the family picture on the Director’s desk. Good looking family. Before you can finish that thought you hear the Director again.

“You see this garbage— I swear it’s like people don’t want to see the truth.”

Shifting your eyes to the Director you see they are using their remote to point to a large flat screen TV embedded into the wood paneling. It’s a special report on Sidney Atanas and his never ending success:

“YOU are going to MAKE them see” sighs the Director. “In fact, it’s the reason you are here.” 

*The director launches into the following speech.*

It's long been assumed that Sidney Atanas, technology and retail entrepreneur, has been using various warehouses to shelter and transport illegal and/or ill-gotten goods. Within the last 5 years, Atanas has dramatically upgraded personal and organizational security capabilities globally making him one a few individuals to embark on obtaining such a sizable and highly organized personal security force. While it is currently unknown how much Atanas is spending on his force, some of your fellow agents have watched a unidentified account owned by Atanas’ parent company ballon from $70 million to $40 billion, much of it going to purchases of landing craft and autonomous drones. The agency has reason to believe that these recent developments indicate Atanas is preparing for a full scale attack: potentially to protect his financial interests or acquire more goods.

For many agents, the acquisition of such aircraft signals an imminent threat which is why the agency put together a small task force responsible for identifying some of the vehicles Atanas frequently uses both professionally and personally. Not only did they identify which cars Atanas uses, they were successful in acquiring an anonymized log of all the coming and goings of three cars. 


## Your assignment: 

Agent for your first assignment we need you to preform cluster analysis on the car log data to divide the data into groups (clusters) that are meaningful and useful in the search for the locations of the warehouses. In doing so, your analysis will provide the agency an invaluable opportunity to affect the course of events in a illegal market. We are suggesting cluster analysis because it is commonly used to detect patters in spatial distribution of the routes traveled/ starting and ending destinations a vehicle has gone to. Given our desire to establish meaningful groups, the clusters should capture the nature structure of the data (do not manipulate it); thus providing us with a useful starting point for where to send field agents for investigation. It should be noted the algorithm you use for your analysis must have some notion of outliers to ensure there is no problem within the domain of anomaly detection. Consider data point density as your method of find outliers.


## Presenting your findings:

> “I’m really counting on your intell to convince the other directors to make a move on Atanas. Agent, DO NOT disappoint me.” 

When you have completed your analysis, you should create a README to act as your official debriefing report detailing your process and the results.


## Creating a debriefing report:

1. Navigate to you fork at random_placeholder_url
2. Create a new branch
  * [How to create a branch] (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
3. Navigate to the appropriate assignment number
4. Create a new folder titled your agent name within the assignment
  * [How to upload files to your branch] (https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/)
5. Fill the folder your just made with the contents of your debriefing. 
   * README: must include 
      - a description of what cluster analysis is
      - what cluster analysis algorithm you used and a brief description of it
      - visual depiction(s) of the warehouse locations
      - any suggestions you have for the agency about next steps to take regarding the warehouses
      - [What a good README looks like] (https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/)
   * CODE: please commit the code you used to do the analysis
6. Commit the file
7. Make a pull request on the main repo 
    * [Everything you need to know about pull requests] (https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
8. Celebrate a job well done
    * Snap a photo of your report and post it to the Messenger chat!

## Getting help with the assignment:

On [insert date], the agency will host a technical workshop at [RPI campus location] to further discuss how to conduct a strong analysis. You are also welcome to reach out to me, Director of Intelligence, via email or the issues section of this repo.
