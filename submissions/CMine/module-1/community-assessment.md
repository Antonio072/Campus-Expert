## Definition
Current: A specific community for this group doesn't exist yet but I think it would do well, especially tapping into the Women in Tech & Computer Science Club groups first for potentially interested parties.

Ideal: Undergraduate students looking to increase their technical knowledge through a breath of CS topics while engaging their creative side in a community/campus wide technical adventure.

## Size
Current: N/A
Ideal: Ideally I would like to have a minimum of 5 people willing to take the adventure. Enough people to make creating technical “assignments” worth it but not too many so the personal feeling is lost.

## Resources
Office Hours:
* While there are currently special office hours throughout the week dedicated to specific CS classes in which a student who might need help with an assignment can acquire help, there is only one resource capable of helping students with any technical projects of their interest: RPI Open Source. The community does an excellent job providing assistance to projects with some structure behind them. This however requires that a student must come with a project already in mind and/or a willingness to join another project. Sometimes you just don’t know what you want to do and you need the structure…which is something I’d like this community to provide!

Clubs:
* Women in Tech Group
* Game Dev Club
* Computer Science Club
* RPI Security Club
* CS Hangout

Course(s):
* For special interest projects: RPI Open Sources

Hackathons:
* Hack RPI: a once yearly hackathon hosted are RPI

## Accessibility

Timing is everything! Most of the available on campus resources, please see the above section, meet throughout the week between the hours of 5pm to 10pm giving people the opportunity to stop by when the day is “officially done”. Childcare isn’t provided to my knowledge, but I certainly don’t believe anyone would have a problem with someone bringing their child along. She definitely added to the questionnaire beforehand!

## Interests

* The community will likely be made up of all CS students, but with only 5 people it’s all good in the neighborhood! (pun fully intended)

* To encourage holistic development of the self, I would love to have some assignments that require those actively on the adventure to participate in other aspects (i.e. student/professor research; RPI music/cimema; speaker series (especially the one I am organizing)  of the RPI community which may or may not be CS related (e.g. attend this event to pick up the next part of the adventure). Some aspects I  It would be a nice touch to the story too!

## Goals

* As students we spend a lot of your time doing assignments that may or may not peak our personal interest. Ultimately too much of this lackluster feeling can spoils the joy of CS. This community seeks to restore the enjoyment of CS through a fun story telling adventure all while putting those good CS skills to use. Below you will find my goals for the community:

(1) Have the assignments make use of standard CS curriculum knowledge
(2) Require participants to attend 1 non-CS on campus event and 1 CS on campus event as part of the event
(3) Have the quest end with everyone meeting and hangout out with each other to talk about the assignments they produced
(4) I want someone to enjoy participating enough that they are willing to continue this leadership and expand upon the idea once I graduate

## Location

* We won’t gather…until the end that is! All assignments will be release virtually so that participants can do them at their own leisure. If there is an specific on campus event required to be attended for the assignment location details will be found in the assignment itself James Bond style.

* Costs: the selected events for the assignment will be of no cost to the participants

## Communication

* Assignments: I like the idea of having the assignments hosted on GitHub because that requires practicing those skills right away. :smile:

* Notifications: A group will be created on FB messenger that broadcasts the location of the events that need to be attended, any changes to the game itself, and other important annoucments. More importantly FB messenger allows me to make the second mission a hubot script!


## Culture

* New ideas? Yeeeesssss! I will provide my contact so if some wants to see a particular topic covered we can try to make that happen.

* Disagreements: Leveraging my experience co-founding RPI’s ACM-W chapter, I know know that all issues can be solved with proper communication. Thus said, I believe special care must be taken to ensure participants have complete access to communicate their needs and interests so story reflects this. As for the code of conduct, I really enjoyed the Contributor Covenant so I think a modified version of that would be great. Additionally, whenever some joins the FB messenger group a bot should inform the new addition of the code of conduct.
