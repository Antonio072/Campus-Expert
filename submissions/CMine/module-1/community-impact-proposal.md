# Community Impact Proposal

## The Idea

Mystery, Drama, Comedy, and CS! Each of the “assignments” posted will bring the participant (aka the agent) one step closer to solving an overarching storyline unfolding before them. They were selected by the agency due to their enhanced technical ability, but will find out that successful ranking within the agency requires more than just technical skills. Agents will be required to attend carefully selected on campus events engaging even the most introverted.   

## The Demographics
 
“The Agency” is a elite organization with high profile clients who require astute collection and analysis of sensitive information to support both the organization’s vision and quarter objectives. To maintain their successful track record, the agency must recruit at least five agents with technical knowledge comprising of at least Introductory CS course and/or Data Structures. Outside of just technical ability, the agency seeks those who are interested in going beyond the standard (in this case course requirements) and are looking for a new adventure that promotes technical and personal self improvement. Aware that backgrounds are varied the agency provides structured support through the sharing of secret meeting locations to talk through recently given assignments to with new agents.

## Communication

Secure communication is a must, given the sensitively of the agency’s clientele and it is for this reason the agency believes in the hidden in plain sight method. Assignments will be posted on a repo with unremarkable characteristics and all notifications about changes with made via FB Messenger. Only those who are trained shall see the markings of the agency.

## Resources

The Director Of Intelligence, CMine, has the required access to reserve the following resources should they be needed:
	* RPI Located Spaces
	* Presentation Materials
	* Additional Computers

## Media

I have reached out to members of the CS Hangout to ask how they would feel about having such an adventure of campus. The reaction gathered from that meeting was positive, but the next step to take would be coming up with a detailed list of the exact topics that could be covered and speaking with professors to take a look at previous homework assignments or ideas they might have for creating the assignments themselves.

## Content Knowledge

As a student leader on campus, I have already started a successful club on campus; hosted widely attended events; and an maintained industry relationships thus giving me the “know how” when it comes to the organization part of this project.

In regards the the content, while I have taken a large body of courses at RPI (everything from Robotics to Computational Biology) I will be leveraging other students and professors to assist with technical areas in which I have working knowledge. Because the backgrounds of the agents are diverse all assignments should be possible to complete without having taken an high level course in the material.

## Timeline

Week 0 (Of Fall Semester): 
* Send Email Announcement to CS & ECSE body announcing the adventure and where the assignments are to be posted.
* Gather a list of topics to be covered. Would like to have a minimum of 4 assignments.

Week 1: Post the first assignment in the adventure 


Week 3: Post the second assignment in the adventure


* Continue posting assignments on two week intervals max (but assignments will be available earlier if they are completed by then).

End of the semester: Organize a meet up for all participants that celebrates all the agents have done during the semester.

## Planning For The Future

Review the impact of the proposal upon completion (end of Fall semester):

What did the agents like? What did they not like? What could be done better? Are there topics that they would like to see covered in the next adventure? Do they even want an next adventure? Would someone be interested in writing a next adventure?

What success looks like?

* Participants finish the adventure, completely the minimum number of the assignments to rank up as an agent.

* Positive scores on the assignment that has some of the questions listed in the previous subsection.

How frequently will you iterate over the community plans?
Hopefully each assignment teaches me about what needs to be tweaked about the community plans, and to ensure that information doesn’t get lost I would be interested in revisiting the plans after the termination of every activity.
