## Nature of the incident
As any long time redditor knows, the comment section of any high ranking reddit post provides copious evidence to support the need for moderation. Now that's not to say redditors are bad people...because that simply posits an irrational basis for the phenomenon that is the comment section. Nope...some people just feel the need to say that *one thing* that never needs to be said. Anyways fast forward to the incident: a redditor posted a wonderful picture of their sibling with their prom date before they left the house for the evening, and it just so happened that both people in the picture had Down Syndrome. Subsequently, the entire comment section was filled with hurtful jokes about having down syndrome and intellectual disabilities. While I am sure they meant well, there is something intrinsically wrong with only being able to find "humor" in the obstacles that someone has to face everyday and no ability to change, in my opinion.

Yet what made the incident memorable to me was the justifications that people were providing for why what they were doing was right. Justifications included everything from "Most of [the jokes] are harmless too, like nobody is making fun of their face or calling them stupid like ya usually see" to "[The jokes]...Doesn't feel as offensive as a lot of other **** people say about folks with Downs." Honestly feels like poor taste to give such weak explications as the ones listed above. To make matters worst comments like those above just help circulate the idea that no one has to be good...just slightly better than the worst and everything is okay.


## Moderation action
Truth be told I have absolutely no idea where any of the moderates were because the comments were flowing without consequence: no deleted comments, the thread wasn't locked, and there was not warning message posted to the top of the thread. Nothing.

One comment was eventually deleted but then it suddenly magically reappeared so I don't think any mods took it down.


## Outcome
Granted I am slightly biased in that I didn't / don't like the idea of making intellectual disabilities jokes, I did see a positive outcome come out of the thread. Some redditors decided to just call people out for their outlandish comments by saying things like "Not exactly. Making fun of disabled people is not frowned upon on reddit as making fun of some other things. It actually saddens me deeply to see this trend being accepted and encouraged." or simply telling the commenter to DELETE THIS. Sometimes it takes the community to help us make better decisions and to all those who stepped up, I have a great level of respect. They truly make the internet community a much better place to be a part of.


## What could have been different?
Sooooooooooooooooo much really could have been differently. The least the moderates could have done was put a serious tag on the post so that before anyone decided to launch their humor campaign they would know that this really wasn't the place for it. I also think that pinning a comment to the top of the thread about what sort of behavior is appropriate would have helped. Needless to say, it wasn't the be all end all.
