# About rishbhr

## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Rishbh Rana, and I am a student, amatuer photographer, radio control cars enthusiast, and a senior at Kean University studying computer science.

##Which organizations do I participate in?

I am a part of two but combined under one umbrella group at Kean University's chapter of ACM, we not only organize the annual hackathon but also help students in learning computing skills.

## Experience

I interned at CBS Local Digital Media, as a Jr. Web Developer where I worked with a preexisting wordpress environment.

## Interests

Cars, Photography, and RC Cars.
When I am not working on a computer and/or not reading I partake in either of the three hobbies.
