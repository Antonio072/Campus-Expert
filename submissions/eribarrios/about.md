Hello world.

My name is Erika Barrios and Iâ€™m currently an IT-software student at Florida International University, where Iâ€™m also helping organize
the first hackathon that really opened my eyes to the magic of the tech community, Mangohacks! With the intention to help as many people
as I could, I began my college journey as a Psychology and CJ double major. I graduated with my BA in 2014 and began working at a 
developmental lab, with hope of joining the director of my labâ€™s phD program. When she finally offered me the position, I was struck 
with the realization that perhaps I wasnâ€™t suited for arguing with the NIH for grant money, or twisting my statistical analyses to best 
improve my chances of publication. So, I considered the route of practitioner instead and interviewed a therapist. He gave me great 
insight and described a few of his patients difficult situations. Therein, he revealed to me something I hadnâ€™t fully considered: 
my overwhelming amount of empathy and compassion would trump my ability to deliver proper, clinical, detached therapy. 

With a desire to help people but seemingly no way to do it, I had a bit of an existential crisis. Thankfully, I had a friend 
who was beginning to study programming on the many free resources online, such as codeacademy.com and freecodecamp.com. 
I recalled my time spent breaking apart myspace layouts simply through identifying the patterns (and how much fun I had doing it) 
and thought iâ€™d give it a shot. 

A few online courses turned into me signing up for CS50x (Hardvardâ€™s introductory CS course) offered through LaunchCode, 
which eventually led me back to the same school I had just graduated in, however, for a degree in IT-software.

The synergy between logical and creative thinking in my class assignments gave me so much energy; I quickly knew I had found 
the right career for me. Finally, a career that could grant me an undeniable reach to impact and improve so many peopleâ€™s lives 
in countless ways, while also providing endless opportunities to continue learning and growing myself and the industry to 
itâ€™s greatest potential. Around this time, I learned about hackathon's. One was being held at my school, called MangoHacks,
so I knew it was time to immerse myself not only in the studies but the community. 

With my laptop in one hand, and my Java beginners book in the other, I walked into my first Hackathon, completely unaware of 
what to expect. To my wonderful surprise, the environment was not at all the cold and distant stigma that follows computer 
science majors. There were probably more people laughing and talking than there were people quietly peering at their computers.
I sat down just to finish some homework and immediately made friends at the next table over. I wasnâ€™t just welcomed, I was 
mentored and guided by just a couple of hackathon veterans, all the while they worked on their project and walked me through their process. 

This air of inspiration, openness and kindness propelled me further into this initially intimidating career and itâ€™s this exact
sentiment and experience I hope to recreate in others, programmers or not. Because technology is an integral part of everyoneâ€™s life, 
it is essential that the users and creators participate in the ongoing discussion about techâ€™s current and future societal impact 
within their community and the world.

P.S. My favorite emoji is one I've been drawing it at the end of my notes since I was a little girl, because it 
looks prettiest/most decorative at the end of sentences. ðŸ’•
