## About Will Walcher
Hey guys and gals! I'm Will Walcher and I'm an 18 (almost 19) year old CS student studying at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.
I'm originally from the United States (Minnesota), but decided to come to Canada, and it's been a great decision!

## Interests
In my free time, I enjoy collecting records, photography, playing guitar, appreciating the outdoors, and learning new tech (of course!)
