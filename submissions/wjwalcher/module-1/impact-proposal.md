## Summary of Community's Needs

**Community demographics:**
Currently, most people within our community are experienced/comfortable with coding, and there are a lot more older students (year 3 and 4), with a severe lack of younger students. This presents an important opportunity and goal to engage and recruit more 1st and 2nd year students who are interested in computer science. Making these students who might be completely new to CS comfortable hanging around other members of our community who might be more experienced is a hope of mine.

**Communication:**
We currently have Facebook groups available for clubs within computer science, and executive members of the CSSS participate in regularly scheduled meetings to discuss what is and isn't working well for the community.

**Culture:**
Culture-wise, I would describe UBC CS's culture as pretty laid back and supportive. Everyone wants to see each other succeed - whether it be doing well on an exam or landing a job. People tend to treat others as they would also like to be treated, resulting in a community where everyone can be themselves without fear of judgement or attack.

## Your Proposal
I would like to discover a way to centralize the various clubs and opportunities available within CS at UBC, making it easy to see what is and is not available, while also drawing the interest of younger students.
**Timing:** Ideally, the process to achieve this goal could begin as soon as possible. The school year is only a month in, so many new students are still trying to find their place within the university.
**Community demographics:** As I have mentioned previously, our community is currently quite fragmented. I want to change this demographic to create a more homogenized core group of students in (and interested in) computer science.
**Goals:** It would be great if we could create a centralized place where you could go and find information about _all_ the clubs and resources available to people who want to get involved in tech and CS. On top of this, it would be amazing if we could make our community more inviting to newer students who might be intimidated to get involved.
**Communication:** Currently communication happens in Facebook groups that you can only be a part of/find out about if you attend meetings for groups in person. It would be nice to create a centralized slack channel which would be easier to find so that more people and new students could get involved and ask any questions they might have.

## Your Proposal's Impact
- Target audience
    - The target audience will focus mostly on newer students who might be intimidated, but the changed implemented will impact everyone involved in CS extracurricular and societies.
- Community needs
    - Our community needs to become more centralized and transparent in order to make opportunities clear to all
- Resources
    - Incentivizing students with free things like food and other swag will draw in potential new students
- Media
    - Facebook posts occasionally draw in students to events happening, but we need to create a better avenue of sharing media amongst each other
- Content knowledge
    - I've helped to bring together and capture the interest of new, timid students before through student run hackathons, so I should be able to assist significantly in this area.
    - I have other student leaders at my disposal who I can ask for help if the need arises
- Timeline
    - The work towards this goal with take place throughout the entire semester, and will need to be in a state of constant advertisement to students.

## Planning for the Future
- Following the end of every semester, we will review how many new members we were able to recruit, as well as how the members of our community have acted towards each other, addressing what is working well and what needs to be changed in order to better our community. When we are able to inspire people of all backgrounds to get excited about computer science, then we will have accomplished our goal.
