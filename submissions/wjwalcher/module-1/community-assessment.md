## Definition
- Students who attend the University of British Columbia and are interested in getting involved with tech
## Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
    - There are around 2000 students in total studying different streams of Computer Science at UBC.
- How many would you like to be in your community?
    - I would like to have as many people as possible in our community - so long as everyone involved in our community is contributing
    to create a positive environment of support and learning, there should ideally be no _limit_  to membership in our community.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
    -  Currently, our community is fairly fragmented into separate clubs within CS (the CSSS, BizTech, App Dev Club, ACM, etc.),
    and it has always been this way. The community as a whole has been growing however, as CS enrollment continues to increase
    every year!

## Resources
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
- Curently (as I mentioned above), we have a range of clubs related both directly (e.g. App Dev Club) and indirectly (e.g. Engineering Clubs that need Software Devs) to Computer Science. We also have an annual hackathon, NWHacks, as well as a Computer Science Student Society, which aims to provide a space for CS students to meet new people and support each other.

## Accessibility
- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
    - Currently, it certainly takes some level determination/involvement to really find the resources that you need sometimes. It's certainly not _impossible_ to access these resources, but they often are not advertised well enough.
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
    - Meetings tend to be held in the evening, when most students do not have classes.
- Is there childcare available?
    - This hasn't been an issue/concern since this is a group of college students who (to the extent of my knowledge) do not have children.

## Interests
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
    - Nope! We also have some business students, arts students, and even cognitive systems students! This is really refreshing, and I would love to continue to grow the diversity of majors that are in our community.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
    - Generally all topics are fair game in our community! If someone finds something interesting, there is almost always someone else who also finds the same subject to be of interest! It's always a refreshing thing to talk about stuff other than CS 24/7 as well.

## Goals
- Why do people get involved in your community?
    - Students get involved in our community because:
        - They want to learn things that classes simply will not teach them
        - They want to meet likeminded/new individuals to form meaningful relationships with
        - They enjoy CS, and want to have fun!
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
    - Have more meetup-type events for people who have a specific interest within (or outside) computer science to simply discuss topics and meet new people.

## Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
    - Currently, we gather in the Computer Science Student Society lounge in the ICICS building. There are also various other meeting places for different clubs within CS and Engineering which meet in ICICS and Engineering buildings on campus.

## Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
    - Currently, Facebook chats are about the only avenue for communication within our community. I would like to explore some other platform for communicating as an alternative to this if at all possible.

## Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
    - Our community is extremely inclusive and welcomes all people and ideas.
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
    - CSSS execs tend to handle any issues that arise
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
    - The CSSS doesn't have an explicit set of rules, but there is a general sense that you should be kind and supportive to others, and do your utmost to respect yourself and others in our space.
- How will you personally handle it?
    - If an issue were to arise, I would speak with one of the executive members of the CSSS who would help me to handle the situation accordingly.
