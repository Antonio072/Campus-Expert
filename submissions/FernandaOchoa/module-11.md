# Exercise 1: Creating SSH key pair

### What is the value in using an SSH agent or GitKraken to setup your SSH keys?
When a person starts using github, normally choose to work with one of the two options that there are CLI or UI, the recommended when you have never worked with version control, because it is the graphical interface provided by github, however this form as well as the of commands the means of verification that offers us as it is the beginning of session, and the configuration in both softwares (UI or CLI).  
While Gitkraken is a graphical environment it offers an extra layer of reliability in our repositories, when using the SSH protocol. Which guarantees us that through a key our information comes from the encrypted server and only our key of our "localhost" will be the one that can decipher it.
### How could you help a Git newbie understand what's happening when they push and pull their contributions to their repo?

In my particular case my bravers when we started with collaboration in github I explain first what the workflow is and how it works, which is a branch, for what it serves, I give examples a little more understandable.

An example of how it is achieved is that of a teacher, the student, and the student.
When they attend classes, the teacher says "well, this will be homework" and each one of them, they have to do their own work according to how they understand it. It can be said that the teacher is our Master, and each of them is a branch that performs different tasks or the same depending on the issues.
When you are going to deliver the tasks first in the samples to the assistant, you must make a request for review to see if you can deliver it, this is our PR, once the wizard checks it, and can deliver it, the moment delivery is that moment is its thrust! If there is any detail, we already have a problem!
After delivering homework and everyone is happy, the teacher takes the time in class to solve the task before everyone, and says, "I'm going to take a random job and I'll check it while I work on it Board
The work he takes is wrong, and he corrects it at the time on the board. When it gives the revised tasks we have two versions that the teacher corrected in front of all and the one that the teacher used to base and to solve the task.

We have two options:
  * The first is that while the teacher resolves it, write it again on a clean sheet (branch) which implies a little more work because then you have to compare both sheets and make them look the same (fetch) to finally deliver it to the Master .
  * or the second option, take our piece (branch) with the wrong task and correct it and then deliver it to the Master.

In a very superficial way so collaborative github works, normally this example I put it real use a couple of sheets and a person to explain what happens, after that I explain that it is an issue and to serve by following the same example.

# Exercise 2: Enabling a GitHook

### Why would a team use GitHooks?
It is a great tool to establish restrictions and maintain a working environment with a good standard, since if you follow a good standard with quality policies that avoid ambiguity, facilitate readability, collaboration, communication in the team and establish good practices, and if we look for good practices, make our code is maintainable and if it is maintainable, it is scalable and if it is scalable we are competitive and we can aspire to better jobs.

### How might you write your own custom hook? What would you want it to do?

I would definitely set restrictions according to the style of programming K&R, in its Java variant (Which is the language that most work) and C of course, because it is with which we have achieved a better reference and helps us in issues of maintainability.
