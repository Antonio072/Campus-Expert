## Summary of the Community's Needs 

**Community demographics**: 
The name of the community is Bravers, at first it would be Bravos, however someone in the voting proposed Bravers thinking that it was the translation of its plural in English and all voted by that name. As a leader, my duty is to see that their decisions are respected and heard.
So the community is Bravers, which means more than brave, means family, it means that group of people who are equally passionate because they love what they do. It is a group of students of the National Technological of Mexico in Leon, which is characterized by two things:

1.- Multidisciplinary
All are welcome, we need other areas to do incredible projects.
2.- Social Impact
All projects that meet, meetups, events, workshops seek to promote the social impact and sustainable development of our context. 

This semester we have 18 people in the community active who meet at least every 3 days, and an approximate 50 people that we help remotely.  

**Communication**: Our channels of communication are informal but effective:
* A Facebook chat for each region and / or subdivision
* As well as groups of whatsapp where we can check issues of urgency.
* We have a drive where, in an organized way, we upload the minutes, agreements, reports and plans for future events.

**Culture**: We have a manifesto where we combine some existing manifests that we find on the internet, and we pick up the decalogue of the hacker culture that has a dev.F hacker school in CDMX and Guadalajara, where I had the privilege of participating in the batch 5.

We analyze, discuss, decide which are applicable to our duty to be.

The manifesto you can find it on impact-proposal.md in the same folder.

## Your Proposal 
We want to start with identifying how many technical skills and different profiles that have the participants, on the basis of which they could be designed some ways of learning, by being open to anyone can define interdisciplinary teams that help and collaborate to solve some problematic social.

These workshops and trainings can replicate them from udacity, codigo facilitito a platform of e-learning very popular in mexico, codecademy, etc.

* Timing: Meetings are usually after school, where We talked about their concerns, new technology issues.  
We evaluate events and possibilities to attend, we help those who who have registered in some competition to improve their skills technicians to do their best.  The hours are after school from 2pm to 4pm and on Saturdays from 10am to 4pm, on some occasions and depending on the members we all meet every day or every 3rd day.


* Community demographics: The increase of participants occurs when we offer more workshops or perform more activities, also the use of social networks helps as a means of dissemination.  We have managed to be able to go from room to room to invite newcomers who are new members to know the community and integrate if they so desire. Sometimes teachers identify children who might be part of the group and send them with us to get to know and motivate them.
In events like FLISOL, HackBajio, DevNights we give talks in which we present a little more about it.


* Goals: Our main objective is to instill the human sense for the development of our community through projects of high social impact.
One of the most effective ways to achieve this is to begin to become aware of our context and that we can also help solve problems or situations that we consider unfair.
That is why we connect with vulnerable areas in the lion, where only a visit to the deficiencies account, also to rehabilitation centers, conferences on the environment and on emergencies that helps us work with our problems.
Being in constant and ecosystems like hackathons and encounters helps your self-esteem increase and see that it is not as complicated as they believe.

## Your Proposal's Impact 

* Target audience: Technological students interested in learning how to build with technology. 

* Community needs: Provide a space where students feel confident in themselves, create, make mistakes and learn to love a community.

* Resources: Quick chatting of internet personalities via hangout.
Implementation of weekly workshops
Make a project per semester that aedmas help us to accredit subjects. 

* Media: Use the diffusion through different accounts in social networks in the Department of Systems and Computation of the Technological.
Go to the halls to make the invitations.
Generate informational leaflets about the community. 

* Content knowledge: I have participated in approx 17 hackathons, I have run the organization of at least 10 events 3 of them of more than 750 people. As Microsoft Student Partner Expert we have pre-fabricated workshops as well as much material available to replicate, the community core has a wide range of knowledge that we can exploit to share.
It is always good to ask for help so we have the desirable networking in Mexico to cover any topic that we could not, and also this internet where we can learn together because that's what it is! 

* Timeline: We plan to do one project per semester in groups of 5/6 people where each one learns the roles of a team, using the Scrumban methodology for agile projects with hardware. Projects of a medium level of complexity where they can participate in the Project Fair of the university and can prove some subjects with it.
The workshops are 2 hours, depending on the workshop some are 10 hours where we see in different sessions the themes.
In the case of courses are Saturdays with a maximum duration of 30 hours. 


## Planning for the Future 
* The impact will be measured at the beginning of the next semester when we count how many new people have entered, ie making a comparison of those who were already and how many people are integrated because if they return is why we did well.

* The success of the community resides in the enthusiasm of the members, if they continue enthusiastic and invite more people, the community wins. If they are not happy and feel bad then we lose.

* We plan to do it every semester and that the members that are already, look for someone with low semesters to join them and they are who guide them, so that if at one point we graduate, the community persists.
