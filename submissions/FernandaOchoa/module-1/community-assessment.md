# Community Assessment 

### Definition 
The name of the community is Bravers, at first it would be Bravos, however someone in the voting proposed Bravers thinking that it was the translation of its plural in English and all voted by that name. As a leader, my duty is to see that their decisions are respected and heard.
So the community is Bravers, which means more than brave, means family, it means that group of people who are equally passionate because they love what they do. It is a group of students of the National Technological of Mexico in Leon, which is characterized by two things:

* 1.- Multidisciplinary  
All are welcome, we need other areas to do incredible projects.
* 2.- Social Impact  
All projects that meet, meetups, events, workshops seek to promote the social impact and sustainable development of our context. 

### Size 
Is a small community because it comes from a larger concept, was born in HackBaj√≠o 2 years ago which we won and members were from different schools and regions of the state of Guanajuato.

After that we went from being a team to a community that has a subdivision of hackathons and video games.

Just this summer we did a pilot program for the constant questions of who could be more in contact, asked for monthly meetings, workshops, consultancies, wanted to visit their universities and replicate the model in their schools.

So we did the Bravers Summer Jam where we had 12 boys from Guanajuato, 3 from Michoacan, 2 from Puebla, 3 from Chiapas, 3 from the federal district, in total there were approximately 25 people and ITL Bravers with now 15 people, which remotely and online we worked, we gave workshops, complete courses, we taught them to use github and to work with a methodology, communication channels, with very good results.

This semester we have 18 people in the community active who meet at least every 3 days, and an approximate 50 people that we help remotely.

### Resources 
The main resources we have are:
* Access to the intelligent systems laboratory in the ITL graduate building.
* I have worked all year to afford you some tools, such as a mini-lab of hardware (great variety of cards, all kinds of sensors, protoboards, actuators, ABC book Hardware and if there is something we do not have and need, make a list and we take care of china) available so that they can work and learn.
* We got some talks with Google Developer Experts, people in Mexico or with a very high technical profile to advise us or give free workshops.

* We have tickets for incredible events and we look for ways to attend together to motivate them.
* We enroll in Hackathons and school competitions, to make mistakes and learn much more.

### Accesssibility 
As far as accessibility is concerned, it is quite comfortable for everyone, since there are spaces available in the university and Dr. Rosario (Dir of the branch of Intelligent Systems of Postrgados) gives us the facilities, as well as access to a microwave and dispenser Water.
The meeting times are flexible, we review the schedules of all (7am to 2pm) and after class we spend 2 hours, when a workshop is held on Saturday in a hackerspace downtown where we are close to all.
The events are mostly in the same city and when this is not the case we look for sponsors or some of us cooperate to attend.


### Goals 
At first we thought that people wanted to be alone to participate in events and things like that, after discovering that they feel comfortable with the way we learn, we help ourselves, not only in the technical part, but we are very worried that more and more people realize how fortunate they are, being able to attend a school and having a professional preparation, to value that opportunity because not everyone has it and as we have a great advantage in being able to educate and learn, precisely help those who they can not and can build a lion with the same opportunities for all.
Where, although we had the fortune of having electric energy, there are those who do not have it and through projects that we realize we can generate alternative solutions and bring them to a dignified life with quality and minimize the digital culture gap.

### Location 
We work in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems of the postgraduate building of the National Technological of Mexico in Leon.  

### Communication 
We have a facebook chat where we agree to everything and when we are not together we do hangout sessions and someone is in charge of carrying the draft. 

### Culture 
We have a manifesto where we combine some existing manifests that we find on the internet, and we pick up the decalogue of the hacker culture that has a dev.F hacker school in CDMX and Guadalajara, where I had the privilege of participating in the batch 5.

We analyze, discuss, decide which are applicable to our duty to be

* We mutually trust that we are vulnerable and authentic.
* We give before we receive or expect something in return.
* We give our energy and time.
* We share openly to inspire and empower each other.
* We are responsible for our mistakes.
* We help each other fulfill our goals and dreams.
* We do magic combining Art, Science and Technology.
* We redefine the home as the people we can not live without.
* We continue our curiosity, no matter where it takes us.
* We redefine the work with new methodologies and tools for collaboration.
* We embrace diversity of origin, disciplines and thoughts.
* We are wrong all the time, because it is the process of growing up.
* We challenge ourselves and the world to address the challenges of our time.
* We accelerate change by releasing human potential.
* There's always something new to learn.
* We take a step forward by getting involved in the causes that move us.
* It is our chance to move the needle on the compass,
and establish new standards based on values and purposes.
* Our destiny is not what is important, it is the journey and the process that we have to reach it.
* This is our opportunity to co-create the World we inherit
