# Community moderation case study

## Analyse a community you manage.

### Nature of the incident

One of the events that we do not only for our community, is open to other universities is the Latin American Festival of Free Software Installation (FLISOL). As part of the dissemination and due to the few resources we had to organize it, we got one of the partners to promote the event to a local television station. (There is something in Mexico that is a collective of communities where those who are registered have tickets to campus party, coldly that is). The interviewer is the leader of the western region of that thing, we are not part of that region since apparently of him, we are nothing ....

This being the context, my partner decided to go to represent us and give the diffusion to said event. We had the pressure from the teachers, the classmates and the few sponsors because the event was a success, since in that week happened other events in some universities.

During the interview the interviewer talked about how great another university was and how much they did for the free software community, making a nightmare for our partner who was not prepared for that.

When the interviewer put a comment on facebook about it, I pointed out that this was not the university, to which he answered in an unprofessional way knowing the responsibility that he has, and that was precisely attended in a public environment because we pretended better advertising and not that we were told on television about the deficiencies of our school.

I must confess that now that I read the thread of the conversation, maybe it was not the best way to treat it.

### Moderation action

Basically, we let him know that the annoyance was to promote another university as the site of our event and that the way in which I treated the partner was not adequate.
We asked him to relax, that he was not supposed to take such negative attitudes, although he did not yield and continued to offend.
After that, I talked to another of the organizers who were in the conversation and asked to leave, (extinction) finally there were more media and it was not worth wearing only for a foolishness.
What really surprised us since he is in charge of about 30 communities, which thank God ours are in the center region and with Bravers we are not in that affiliation, since we do for other causes, which are far from achieving free tickets.

### Outcome

The result was unexpected, as other communities read the conversation and showed their disagreements, they helped us by sharing the event and we had a good reaction from the public.

What could be different?
In Mexico there is an expression to say "relax" and it is "Relax, eat a snickers (the chocolate)" I think that to use that expression was my mistake since I annoy it more, and for that reason it began to lack respect to us.

### What could be different?
We must choose better the means and the expressions of communication, I learned how important it is to choose battles and how to deal with people that only go to unbalance the community, nevertheless we made the decision that Bravers was not affiliated with this type of communities that although some are astonishing are also toxic people, we have some affiliates and therefore we are in the center region, only that Bravers that is dedicated to blood, sweat and tears do not affiliate because the goal is different.

Something that I liked a lot was a reading where they talk about when to receive a compliment, and it is that it costs me a lot, it has helped me a lot to realize that sometimes the only thing I have to say is "Thank you".
