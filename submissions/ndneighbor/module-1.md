# FIU's Student Tech Landscape

The school never really had a solid tech presence until very recently. But in order to understand that you must first understand the history of the relationship with tech and the city of Miami. 

At the start of the 70s, the information revolution was at the cusp of exploding. IBM held a research and manufacturing office in Boca Raton and many other companies set up relationships with the IEEE and ACM chapters over at Florida International University and the University of Miami. It was around this time, community pioneers like John C. Comfort and the open computer lab and the local community college giving classes in computer literacy to understand the IBM mainframes. It was this framework that allowed Alienware and Origin PC to form up along with a few tech export companies to source software and hardware to Latin America.

However come around the 80s the university pull and relationships with other companies brought tech to California and around the time of the 90s. A perform storm of resources and corporate support brought the rise of Silicon valley and left a shell of what used to be in Miami. The idea of being on the edge of programming languages and companies faded away just like the beaches on the shores of Florida. There would be notable alumni from the city but ended up leaving for greener pastures, people like Roby Abovitz and Jeff Bezos.

Around 2010, come to the turn of the mobile explosion and arguably the fourth developer wave. (The coming of age of SaaS, Apps, and APIs) Miami was basically just a few tech companies, Sentey (PC Periferals), TigerDirect (PC Parts store, now defunct), Ultimate Software (HR Payroll Software). But with a void comes demand.

## Currently

FIU's first student tech club started with the chartering of the first ACM chapter in 2001. It was this alumni that was able to trickle into local companies and post dot-com boom software consultancy companies. 

Around 2012, Irvine revived ACM and started regular meetings that brought 10 or so students. At the time, FIU didn't really have great student draw and the CS program was around 100 students of all years. Over time as Computer Science got more and more known as a valid career path, YPE started up as the honor society that was started as a way to get higher grades. These clubs did workshops and made a environment for people to join. 

These clubs struggled because starting and supporting communities struggled and the initial wave of students eventually graduated leaving people lost as to find a place to hang out. Since FIU is primarily a communter school and serves a less affluent area, many students are older and work part or full time away from campus. It's different than most universities because the oppurtunity time is limited where students are unable to go to tech events because of time conflicts. 

YPE grew because of the ability to market heavily and setting up key relationships with academic members of the school. They set up a marketing pipeline but then aimed to snuff out other clubs. Come 2014, they ran a candidate and brought YPE members to vote for the candidate, he was elected. Then the new presdient held no content and let the ACM die a third time. So for a brief period there was only one club that represented the interests of the students.

Later around 2014, Juan Alvarado would be a student starting to come back fulltime at the school while he worked at the software development firm GoIDX and started going to hackathons, it was also Alastair Paragas who took the helm of the ACM and revived it. The new ACM memebers were a group of friends that just so happened to go to hackathons together. It was a club of 7 people but later invited new members because of the impulses to evangelize (notably Haskell). Come 2015, ACM and YPE would grow separately, where YPE would have 50 active members and ACM would have 10. The school at this time has 300 CS students. 

Juan after traveling the country and going to hackathons regularly wanted to bring a tech community like the ones he saw at BitCamp, MHacks, and HackFSU. (Fun fact, it was because the tech community that didn't exist that drove a former FIU student Diva Hurtado to FSU in 2012 that would get her to found HackFSU in Florida State come 2013.) Juan started putting the ground work to make MangoHacks happen. Juan realized that there was blood between the two clubs and aspired to make MangoHacks independent. While that was happening, core community memebers Alastair and Xavier would go on to start hosting workshops of niche tech that would bring other friends on board.

As the clubs grew, a WICs chapter sprouted up, concurrently a Theta Tau chapter sprung up, the NSBE and SHPE membership grew and other time the engineering and tech communities started to mature. After the first MangoHacks there became a regular presence of Florida people that would hang together and there became a consistent group of hackathon attendees that would go on to informally create FIUHackers. As these students and the reach of hackathons grew the clubs existed without conflict. 

Around 2016 would have the major grow to 400 students, and ACM having 40 regular members and YPE with around 90. 

The tech community strongly identifies with their clubs and many students have still have yet to be evangelized or notifed that you can meet friends and learn things that will bring you closer together. 

## The proposal

The issue is, these clubs have history where the politics prevent great things from happening. Just like how Florida Hackers was able to lower the barrier of school pride between two clubs. 

There exists tribalism within the school that needs to be mitigated. It is okay to fork and improve on things and it isn't the goal of a good community to put things under one iron unbrella. But Hackathons and outreach are two things that are sorely needed in Miami. MangoHacks has been working on that for the past 2 years, but there is still more we can go besides just being an event once a year. We want to work with all orgs t help them host great content for every student to get an internship. It was 4 years ago that maybe only 5 students at FIU had an internship. Now that number is up to 50.

Hackathons have allowed any student of any disipline to learn and grow as developers and leaders. FIUHackers would be the perfect fit to provide mentorship, content for developers who are looking to go from Hello World to product. YPE provides excellent beginner content, ACM provides excellent expert content. But where is the bridge to biology students who would greatly benefit from Python courses for scientific computing, getting business students to understand development so we can have better PMs who understand tech.

The goal is to bring tech to Miami, and bring Miami into tech.

The city seems like it has always been 5 years behind with it's education, community and diversity efforts. It's time to bring hacker culture to the place that could have been. 

the mission: lower the barrier into the world of hackathons and tech

If people find that there are more specific goals, we will help them turn those ideas into functioning clubs and give them support. We find this parallel in the Node project

Grunt -> Bower -> WebPack

or language

Perl -> Ruby -> Elixir

or even online communities

HH -> CdT -> Tq

A hackathon is just an efficient setting for community building. Hackathons don’t do much if they don’t have people. It’s a cool experience for sure, and tech is hot, so it’s bound to be interesting. But if a school has their first hackathon, and the attendees don’t get a sense of belonging to something, or being part of something where they can express themselves, they might not come back next time. Or maybe they will because hey, it’s the yearly thing to do where I’m doing something that’s not homework. But the value comes when the people tell their team, or their friends, “Experience this with me”.

And that doesn’t necessarily have to be a 200 person annual event.
The value of the hackathon is similar to the value of getting a group of people joining a soccer team and playing with others. It’s a chance to expand the community.

A community is what drives the interesting things. Or what makes the things that happen interesting to the people involved, because of the people involved. It’s what drives the, let’s go to another state for this event, let’s get on this 12 hour bus ride, let’s escape on the middle of finals week and have fun, let’s see how far we can take this idea.
