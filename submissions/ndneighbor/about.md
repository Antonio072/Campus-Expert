Hello Everybody! I am Angelo Saraceno, unashamed lover of Haskell and burritos in that order. My friends call me Neighbor! Based out of Miami, Florida I attend Florida International University. A former EE but then the hackathon bug bit me and now I am a CS major with a large hackathon family. I have been extremely greateful to be introduced to a welcoming community of techologists who love their craft and I feel it is nessisary for me to give back. So I have dedicated my final years at university to give them the same opportunities I have had.

I have been organizing for MangoHacks as it's co-director for its 2017 and 2018 editions. And I do cool things for Florida Hackers for Floatie and other initiatives. I find that tech events are best way to get people hyped up about tech and the best way it scales is by having people meet other passionate people.

## Interests

You can find me running, telling bad jokes, teaching, designing avant-garde art, running late to class, and screaming at my computer for fun. 

Professionally speaking, I am a DevOps Engineer and a jack of all trades in the field of CS. My attention span won't let me pick a focus, so I picked all of them. I have a interest in making my distro look good, supporting developer communities, preparing for the coming AI apocalypse, and trying to be the only kind person in Blockchain.

## If you need help!

If I don't spend my time helping people, I spend my time playing XBOX so in reality you are helping me out.
