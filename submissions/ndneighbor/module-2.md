# Community Case Study

One secret that people don't know about me is that I have been moderating the "hackbook" space for around a year or so. It all has started with myself participating in Hackathons and then realizing that there is a giant network of facebook groups with like minded peers and I just feel in love with it's inside jokes and content to make me a better developer. Beginning with Hackathon Hackers and all it's subgroups I joined around December 2015 in preparation to go to my first hackathon. 

For the unititiated, "hackbook" is the term I have named it after spending the valuable time of many working hours "wasting" my time on these online communties have have gone on to provide great things for their community that have led me to join many in person meetups at different hackathons and have given me a platform to build many friendships and a career on.

This space is made up of Hackathon Hackers, HS Hackers, Cirque Du Twerque, Teque and many of it's offshoots. There are also parralell groups that exist in this realm, like the online mirrors of physical communities like HH South that later led the foundations for the online mirror of Florida Hackers. There also are separate FB groups that are of varying quality that also make up this space from the 4chan-esque "/>p/" to the extremely open International PHP Facebook Group. There is a flowchart for the online hackathon space that allows you the layman to get involved with all the lore that is FB groups.

Being a historian for an online community sounds dumb but there is quite a bit of information and history that tends to get lost in the sands of a webserver. There are meaningful stories that get lost over time as people grow from one community to another. Being a part of a forum is one of my fondest memories as a child as the sense of belonging was a extremely important theme for me growing up. (Something difficult when you are only PC Gamer in a middle school and was busy getting head first into tech.) My journey from Game Forum Participant -> Forum Moderator -> Murky Online IRC -> RP Group -> Startup Community Member -> FB Meme Page Moderator is a long one. 

In particular, this case study will mostly be about the forming of a new group when a void is filled by a new group in the user space. We are going to look at Cirque du Twerque and the actions of the moderators during the unfortunate Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting.

Despite everything, I was so excited as it was always difficult for me to be surrounded by so many different and extremely smart people. So the interwebs was the perfect place for me to learn literally everything.

## Problem

Cirque du Twerque around the summer and reaching it's one year anniversary was maturing to a point where many of the new memebers didn't realize or understand the Facebook group's history and as a result they treated it like a tech trash dumpyard where people were valuing "free-speach" over the protection of the shared values of it's community members.

People argued that since the goal of the group was humor and parody above all else, people forgot about the underlying foundation that brought everyone together and subsequency fostered some trolls to come into the community started to be mean to each other. At the time the rules weren't really in place to prevent some of that behavior and considering the history and past of that facebook group we later realize that the idea of democracy was extremely important as a core value but is fundamentally unsustainable if there isn't shared values for the common core.

Around the time of the event, there was also the attacks in France which led to a moderate action but the community still made jokes about them because the reach wasn't to the same extent of the notority of the events. Also (its always a horrible thing to compare loss of life) but the number people affected didn't warrant the type of response that was happening. Cirque du Twerque's young primarily college aged men didn't really see the issues when it came to problems such as empathy and trying to make a community to be inclusive because it's primary assumption was that people were just there for humour.

The interesting thing is you can't have that both ways, you can't claim to just be a facebook group with no meaningful imact if you have regular meetups in different cities and be the conduit of many people's tech careers and then based off of that restrict people by scaring them away with toxic behavior. So at the time the evolution of the group had some important questions to handle. You had a faction that took things too seriously and another faction that didn't and would revel their trolling. Especially considering much of the original content was satirical in nature. Along this time the FB auto bans were very prevailent because much of the issues were users writing things like "i hope you die in a fire :)" but it seemed like the spam filter treated those comments as inflictions on the community guidelines.

With all these factors going at play, CdT seemed like it was headed for another drama filled session which wasn't new for the group that was partically responsible for taking down Post Asthetics and being a thorn on the side for the Hackathon Hackers moderation crew. 


## Action

One of the admins first instituted a "meme-freeze" so no posting about the event was allowed along with an explaination. If people disliked the explaination, there was a discussion thread that people were pouring over to try to sort ut the core values of the group. 

In addition multiple votes were had to discuss the ideas and the identity of the core group leading to the creating of many sub-groups to serve the niches of the user groups that weren't identified. The admins reached out to many community members in Orlando to console them. The people that weren't trying to use this to use this as a way to crack a few jokes at the expense of other people's horror rallyed and supported the victims of the attack.

The admins also made sure any offenders were kicked from the group, and there was a renewed focus on the community aspect. Around 2 weeks later, CdT would go on to have it's first large scale meet-up.



## What could have been done better?

I felt that were was too much time used to explain and the time it took to deliberate an action allowed for many members to be scared away and people might have gotten hurt. Also many of the serious members that made content later used this opportunity to create a group called HH Politics would become a bed of political posting that would later parody CdT. Thier members would cause some problems later on.
