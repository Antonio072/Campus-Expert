Hello Hackers, Coders, Experts, and all alike !!!!!

My name is Mit Amin and I am an undergraduate computer science student at Virginia Commonwealth University.  

I really enjoy going to Hackathons with my team Code-blooded, if I'm not studying for an exam I'm most likely at a Hackathon.  

I guess my favorite emoji would have to be ðŸ˜’ because I'm your typical millennial who just constantly "over it", speaking of which, I'm over this, bye. 

(I hope you can read the sarcasm I was trying to convey through text, cause I'm that kind of intellectual)
