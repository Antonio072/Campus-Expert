# Ademola Abisayo Paul
Hello , I am Paul .
I am a student of Agricultural and Bio-resources Engineering in the Federal University of Abeokuta , Nigeria . I am currently in my second year of a five year course . Here in school I am passionate about technology and making people to see the impact technology can have here in my country. As a result of this, I joined the Google Developer Group chapter in my school where I was part of the team that organized the Google I/O extended 2017 in my school which turned out to be a huge success .

# Interests
Currently I am  into Web development using PHP , JS but I also hope to go into machine learning and data science some time in the future because I believe it can be used to solve a lot of problems here in Nigeria . I also find DevOps very very interesting and I would love to do some of it in the future .
I love football ( soccer ) very much and gisting, hanging out with with my friends !
I specifically love Manchester United ðŸ˜€ .
