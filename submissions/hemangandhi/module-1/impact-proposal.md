# The Needs

The community essentially needs a space for open source contributors to build
awesome projects and share them.

There are at least 100 interested people, judging from club attendance and the fact
that Rutgers continually swamps local hackathons. (We take pride in our reputation.)

A lot of the changes needed are in the form of simple fixes: we should maintain our
current means of communication.

# My Proposal

Through the campus experts program, I hope to expand the "hacker culture".
The big problem at Rutgers is that while many people go to Hackathons, most don't feel like demoing.
Furthermore, people don't do side-projects, mostly because they don't know of good side projects.

These two problems seem related: people aren't inspired to make side-projects, so at Hackathons,
we think they have some difficulty coming up with ideas they think are good enough.
For course, there is the impostor syndrome associated with that too: they don't think they're
project should be demoed, but we think that having a community that builds similar projects would
alleviate this. Naturally, we will be collecting data for this soon.

The hope is that by having a space focussed on side-projects, this will change.
This space will exist over the semesters and we will pretty much experiment to find the perfect space.

Right now, we believe that regular meetings (weekly or every other week) would suffice.
Soon we may have to alter this. That's up to experimentation.

This will be quite accessible to the community as it will be spread through the main
means of communication - the Facebook groups, the mailing lists, and a few of the slack channels.

Hopefully, this will cause the number of people interested in increase.

# The impact

The hope is to impact everybody who's interested in open source contributions.

The impact will be seen in an increase in contributions by Rutgers hackers.

The resources are mostly just time and space which will require planning and coordination with the clubs.

The media will include some mentorship/workshops on tech and details of open source contributions.

I'm not as content knowledgable as I'd like to be. The knowledge is something I'd like to get through this program.

The timeline would start in September, when I'll announce the first meetings. There will be contributions for HackRU-related projects until October.
After that, hopefully, there will be enough momentum to continue with other projects.

# Planning for the Future

I'll review the impact by the increase in Rutgers student projects - the number of side projects, open source contributions, and hackathon submissions.
Basically stalking GitHub.

I'll iterate on the plans at least every semester. If something isn't working,
I will iterate sooner.

# Some Project Ideas

We really would like to have projects come from all over Rutgers.
I have a somewhat outrageous plan to walk the entire Rutgers involvement fair (a gathering of all Rutgers clubs)
to drop the USACS email so that we get projects from the Rutgers community.

We are also aware that social good projects can come from the town of New Brunswick. I will reach out around the town
to see if we can get projects.

Current CS communities and clubs do not have many tooling needs, except for HackRU (but I may just be more aware of HackRU's needs).
I believe that most clubs are yet able to leverage their general tools well enough.

# A (Very) Rough Timeline

This timeline is rough because we do not know how certain things will play out. Essentially, we have to ensure that we
manage expectations: that people know that our gatherings are not purely for mentorship, that there is no deadline for certain projects,
but others may have one, and, of course, there will be a sort of code of conduct.

1. Set up: find projects, have code of conduct. This would be before the semester and may be the first week.
1. Interest meeting -> week 2 or 3 of the semester. We announce a few projects and check on interest.
1. Fortnightly meetings to check in on projects and collaborate. We may also meet during/before hackathons.
1. Final presentation. We let people demo any cool thing they did.

This will most likely happen next spring, but I hope to run around the involvement fair too, so that might push us to do
it next month.
