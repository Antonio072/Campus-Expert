# The Rutgers CS Community

(Or at least the parts I see.) Rutgers has around 400 graduating CS seniors. Furthermore, many electrical engineering (ECE) and maths majors like getting involved with CS.

### The CAVE - more background

I just thought that some more background would help.

Thanks to our faculty (in particular, a handful of interested parties), the Rutgers CS
community has benefited from having a constant space for hanging out, socializing, and events.
This space is called the CAVE (**C**ollaborative **A**cademic **V**ersitile **E**nvirnoment, I'm told).

The CAVE is left open by iLab assistants, students employed by the department to manage the space. Additionally, club leaders have access to keep the CAVE open when needed.

## Details of the Status Quo

### Definition

The community I care about the most can be summarized as "people interested in building projects at hackathons and spreading tech beyond CS."
There may be an emphasis on social good projects over technically challenging ones.

### Size

Currently, it's hard to know how many people are in this community because it is not provided for too much. There might be at least 30 people
who would be in this.

I'd like there to be 100 or more people as I feel that there are about these many interested people.

I believe this group has been growing as CS at Rutgers has been growing exponentially and awareness of social good tech has been on the rise.

### Resources

Currently, there are a ton of resources for the community to learn about tech. However, these resources are either narrow or do not last
the lifetime of a project.
The current resources either focus on a particular type of project (mostly either game dev or mobile dev) or simply offer a quick glance at
a potential project, not a place for people to come together and simply work in a community.
In fact, USACS used to have such a resource - called a "Hack Night", but those gradually changed to workshops and then disappeared.

The resources are (as far as I know):
- "Hacker hours" at USACS: quick workshops on various tech topics that aren't covered in class. Almost Rutgers branded MLH localhosts.
- HackRU: our hackathon every semester.
- HackHERS: our female-focused hackathon held every spring.
- The USACS mentorship program: underclassmen can be paired with upperclassmen and upperclassmen with alumni for CS and career advice.
- HackRU R&D: provides a few programmers (called architects) the chance to build projects that will be used at HackRU (at least).
- RUMAD: provides contract freelancing opportunities to aspiring mobile developers. Also hosts meetups for IoT development.
- COGS: has meetups and mentorship for game developers. Also runs a game jam sometimes.
- Rutgers Hackathon Club: this is a Facebook group for interested Hackathon goers, but it is poorly maintained and now mostly alumni.
As described above, RUMAD and COGS are the end-to-end resources for projects, but only in their field. HackRU R&D is similarly tied to HackRU
right now. The rest are either not well-used, well-marketed, or do not support a project from end-to-end.

### Accessibility

Freshman can find USACS easily and to get fed into their CS niche quickly, so accessibility in terms of younger people is not a problem.

Meeting timing is a huge challenge. Clubs try not to overlap, but we have run out of week nights. Unfortunately, we also have to compete
with higher-level classes that end at 9:30. So far, most meetings have tried to be well-timed, but it has not always worked out.

There isn't any available childcare. The CAVE is wheelchair accessible with only one doorway that might be tediously narrow.
These considerations are a little difficult for us since we do not have much control over it. Most venues are not much better
for accessibility, unless we moved off campus, which would cause problems for the majority of attendees.

### Interests

The community is not _only_ CS majors. It is mostly CS majors, but engineers have come through.
I'd estimate something on the order of 80-95% CS and the rest mostly ECE (Electrical & Computer Engineering).

The community is a bit of both: there are very open sectors and there are some somewhat closed ones. USACS is general, so is extremely open.
COGS, on the other hand, focusses on game development (though, as far as I can tell, is open within that space).

### Goals

The people get involved to be a part of HackRU and, as a result, have things for their resume and a friend group.

The students definitely want a degree.

They are trying for a job. Mostly great internships.

They are mostly very passionate developers. However, for many, career is the top priority.

The most fair goals would reflect resume-building projects. This would need the supporting work shops, hack nights (cookies and code),
and mentorship as well.

### Location

The community gathers in the CAVE. A mystical resource center where all the CS majors hangout on occasion for mentorship and socializing.
However, this may not be the entire community.

There is a place - the CAVE.

There is parking nearby. It requires Rutgers permits, but most interested members have this.

There is public transportation. Mostly in the form of Rutgers buses - they suffice for most until past 11pm.

The location is accessible to everybody on campus, however, for off campus attendees, it is not the more convenient.

The space is free - Rutgers doesn't charge us for its use.

The space is quite flexible. A portion of the room is regularly re-arranged (in a 15 minute game of Tetris) to accommodate board meetings and presentations.

We can accommodate around 60 people without trouble and are open to moving to nearby larger lecture halls if needed.

There is comfortable seating for most people.

There are water and snacks nearby.

### Communication

Mostly a slack channel and events.

We have a slack channel and email. Hopefully, we'll use our GitHub organization soon.
However, openness is hindered by our use of messenger over slack - many times there is a messenger group instead of the slack
and that slows inclusion down.

We could benefit from a better slack and Facebook. A GitHub organization may be helpful for team coordination.

### Culture

So far, new people and new ideas have been very welcome.

The club mostly relies on directors and leaders to sort out larger disagreements.
The smaller disagreements are usually sorted out among the disagreeing groups.

There are policies - mostly a code of conduct for our place, the CAVE. Procedures, in dire cases,
can be escalated to Rutgers where they will be duly processed.
This would occur through the aforementioned iLab assistants as well, if the CAVE is involved.

Personally, I will continue the tradition of escalating relevant issues.

## Things to improve on

The key issues are diversity and the fact that, for the community described above,
there is no direct club. Most clubs accommodate this community tangentially.

There are a few key ways we hope to fix this: (categorized in the same way as the questions)

### Interests

Hopefully, we will make a space to cater to the interests of open source contributors (or would-be open source coders).

Also, hopefully there will be a focus on social good projects and spreading the impact of CS beyond CS.
This is not the largest focus, but it is an important "side-goal."

### Accessibility

We should strive for better hours, at least at the start of semesters,
even if that means the most experienced members cannot attend.

### Location

The CAVE is becoming too small rather quickly. In fact, despite ideas to expand it,
the reality is that if even 10% of the major actually came to the events,
the CAVE would be out of space. (We do believe that most CS majors should, at some early point,
come check out the CAVE.)

That highlights that we have to be more flexible with our spaces: it is impossible
to regularly host much of Rutgers CS in one place. (We do so every semester through HackRU.)
As a result, we should look into using other spaces all over the campus, allowing the needs of the events to determine the best places.

### Communication

GitHub will have to be more used if the open source contributing community grows.

Slack too should be put to more consistent use. We will have to be sure to help people understand how to use slack.
