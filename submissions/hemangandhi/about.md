## About me (the "work" stuff)

Hi! I'm Heman (pronounced Hay-mun) and I'm a Rutgers student studying CS and mathematics.
I'm HackRU's director of R&D (our tech team) and am tech chair for USACS, the umbrella club HackRU falls under.

I hold the above positions because I am very interested in keeping Rutgers coders hacking and exposing them to the open source world.
Hopefully my efforts will also lead to Rutgers coders contributing to the local community.

### The related interests

I love programming language design, Lisps, Haskell, and (hopefully soon) Rust.
I've ended up choosing to love web dev over hating my life.
I also dabble in data science and ML, but not too much.

I am a Linux + VIM nerd too!

And in math, I'm more of an algebraist, so I can bore you about basic group theory.

## About me (the not-so work stuff)

Outside of studies, I play Go, read Sci-Fi, and pretend to be able to write.

In terms of sports, I love ping-pong, badminton, and tennis, though will also chuck a Frisbee.

I love watching and reading hours of random blogs and videos covering topics from Monadic burritos to small apartments in Tokyo.
