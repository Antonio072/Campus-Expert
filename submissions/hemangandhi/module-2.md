# Case study

I guess I'm lucky in that this is the worst thing I can remember seeing.

## The nature of the incident

I'd like to say this is a well (or, reasonably) intentioned person messing up.

Essentially, we were planning a surprise party for a friend who could not eat
pork or drink alcohol, on a slack team.
As a result, somebody jokingly offered to celebrate the day with a roast pig
and drinks.

But it did not stop at that questionable joke. The person kept posting (spamming)
pork dishes (and getting creatively annoying).

## The action

At some point, a moderator started deleting the messages.
This stopped the person from pigging out.

It should be noted that extinction didn't work, but most likely because
the party planning channel had been quiet.

## Outcome

The person stopped messaging pork dishes.
If I recall correctly, he later on admitted that the moderation action showed
him that he was wrong.

## What could be different?

If the moderators could have stepped in earlier, I'd have love to see them
try to tell him that the continued messaging was not appreciated.
I'm sure he'd have understood his actions were wrong and I think it would
have been slightly nicer to hear the objection instead of just seeing messages
vanish.

Essentially messaging a "please stop spamming pig dishes, that's not funny" would have been nice
to hear from the moderators. Especially a bit sooner.

Also, it would have been nice to see this formalised in a code of conduct. One
did not explicitly exist (or at least, not one for the slack). There were other
codes of conduct as a part of this community, but it wasn't very clear whether
those applied to the slack team.

A code of conduct would have allowed another person to step in
with confidence and prevent this. Additionally, a code of conduct
may have prevented the person from spamming in the first place by simply
making it clear that that action was not appreciated.
