Hi, I'm Vincent

I go to the University of Toronto at Scarborough majoring in Computer Science and Specializing in Software Engineering.
I've had the chance to work with big enterprises like IBM and Canada Post to start-ups like ReEnvision Digital Marketing and Lamify.
I'm always looking for exciting projects to work on, ways to build up my profile, and (try to) go to every Hackathon possible.
