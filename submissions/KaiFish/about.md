Hi, I'm Kai. (Hi and Kai should rhyme if you are pronouncing it correctly) I am not a CS student, but a Linguistics major. I got into compsci through a round about route, but I'm in the thick of it now. I attend the University of Oklahoma, but I spent the 2016-17 school year as a student at the University of Sheffield in Sheffield, England. It was in Sheffield that I got into hacking and the community behind it. Now back in the states, I want to help that community thrive wherever I am.
