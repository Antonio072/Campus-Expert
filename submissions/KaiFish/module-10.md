# NJCS: Not Just Computer Science
- Give your club a name!
  * club name needs improvement
  
- State the purpose/mission. Talk about the unique niche the club is addressing.
  * Purpose: To provide both a gathering place and support network for "non-traditional" CS students. These non-traditional students can be students pursuing the CS minor, especially those whose major is not in the school of Engineering, but can also be students who have an interest in Computer Science/Programming, but haven't been able to take a class, or only taken one or two.
  * Niche: This recognizes the difficulty non-engineering students have in getting involved in engineering extracurricular groups, and the associated intimidation. Also, it provides a way for similar students to find each other, in a world that can seem isolating to those who do not fit the mold. 
  
- Describe the benefits and activities your club will offer.
  * Regular meetings will allow students to share experiences and support each other 
  * Workshops will provide education not provided in the classroom, and also provide an entry point for students who have an interest in computer science, but have not taken formal classes. 
  * Mentorship programs, perhaps in collaboration with established CS groups, to pair experienced programmers with newbies. 
  
- A good point to address is how the club falls under the university's/student union's/etc mission. Try to include how the need is not currently being met on campus.
  * Reaching out to educate those who want to learn generally falls under the (very generic) mission statement of the University, linked below. 
  * The specific need is not currently being met. SACM (linked below) is a new(?) society that may help achieve this goal, and NJCS may be able to fit under its umbrella. 
  
- State how the club can continue to grow in the future.
  * Once established, the club can provide continued outreach to students who may not have considered CS as an option because of assumed difficulty in breaking in to the subject
  
- Will the club made up only of computer science students?
  * In a loose definition, as explained above by "non-traditional" students
  
- How will your club communicate?
  * Facebook seems to work for most fledgling clubs, but this may change with feedback from students and change in size. Groupme is also popular on campus. 
  
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
  * Ideally, everyone behaves like a rational adult and talks out their issues, but upon actually acquiring founding members, I'd like to formalize a process to make sure everything goes smoothly.
