## Summary of the Community's Needs
The community does not exist in coherent, unified form yet. I'd like to make that happen.
- **Targeted Community demographics**: Non-traditional CS students, who may or may not yet be actual CS students, but would like to learn about tech, programming, and hacking. 
- **Communication**: This will be determined and shifted as the community grows, to best fit the community. 
- **Culture**: Students who feel intimidated by the CS field, and are unsure of how to break in


## My Proposal
- **Timing**: Over the fall semester, I would like to determine if the desire for the community is truly there. By spring, I would like to be running regular (weekly?) workshops and meet-ups.
- **Community demographics**: I plan to advertise anywhere and everywhere I can on campus. The workshops will probably be bi-monthly at first, to see if there is the desire for them. I would really like to run an intro to python course over the fall semester, to try to get people who want to learn to code, but don't have the time to take a course. 
- **Goals**: If there is a community by the end of the year I have succeeded. I want to bring people who feel itimidated together, so they don't feel as scared. 
- **Communication**: Again, regular workshops and meetings, probably organized over Facebook and advertised around campus, as that is the easiest and most universal way of reaching everyone. 


## Impact
If one person feels less intimidated by the world of CS, I have had a positive impact. 

## Needs
- a more graphically talented friend to make posters and ads would be hugely helpful
- I'd like to run a multi-week Python Workshop, aimed at people with no programming experience. Suggestions?
- Doing this alone will quickly get exhausting. How can I best find people who want to help?
  - talk to professors? y/n?

## Planning for the Future
- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
  - Monthly reviews of progress would be most helpful, to see where we've been and plan out the next month
- How will you measure success?
  - Workshop/meeting attendence will probably be my primary form of appraisal, but feedback from those attending will also be important 
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
  - bi-monthly at first, weekly if the demand is there.
