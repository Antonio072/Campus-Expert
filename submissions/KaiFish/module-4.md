# :turtle: :turtle: :turtle: Teaching Newbies Python with Turtles :turtle: :turtle: :turtle:
## Learning Goals:
- How to use command line
- How to write basic code
- How to use documentation as a reference
## Part One:
#### 1. Assess group skill/technology
- What are we working with? Macs? PCs? Did everyone bring a computer?
- Do people know how to access terminal/command line?
- Have people used terminal/command line before?
#### 2. Download the goods. 
- Install Atom (out of personal preference and familiarity)
- Install Python3
## Part Two:
#### 1. Hello World
- Obligatory introduction to basic coding
  - Integers
  - Strings
  - Print statements
#### 2. Live coding.
- Work through the code step by step--
  - Why do we need import statements? 
  - What are modules in python?
  - Naming/referencing variables
  - Types and objects
  - etc
#### 3. Complete planned code
- This can be done over multiple interations with different results ie:
  - Make the turtle walk in a straight line
  - Make the turtle walk in a square
  - Introduce for/while loops to make cool patterns
#### 4. Introduce documentation
- What is documentation?
- What can you do with it?
- How can you read it?
#### 5. Experimentation
- Allow students to go through the Turtle module documentation to find new things to do with their turtles
- Walk around and help out
#### 6. Demoing
- Let students show off what they did
## Part Three:
- Questions and feedback from students
