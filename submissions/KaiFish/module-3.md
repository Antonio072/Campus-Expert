# Talk Proposal:
# How to Make the Most of Being an Exchange Student

## Abstract:
I will use stories of my time abroad to provide others with advice on how to make the most of their time abroad

## Description:
Going abroad is a terrifying experience in theory; you must leave everything you know, including the friends and comuunity you have found at University, and throw yourself into a foriegn culture (that might not speak your native language!) and start your social life from scratch. It is very much like the transition from high school to University, but with a culture barrier plus an expiration date and on everything you do there. It's a hard task for any student. 
I have been aborad as a student twice now, under very different circumstances. First was as a high school student with a group of american students in Germany for a summer. Then, in college, I spent my junior year abroad in England. I will use my experiences from both to explain to my audience, which I assume are mostly university students, how I adapted to the different challenges that presented themselves over my time abroad. These challenges will include:
    * living in a country where your native language is not primarily spoken
    * getting involved at your host institution
    * differences between going with a group of similar students vs on your own
amongst other issues. I will present my talk by presenting the challenge, telling a related story, and then going through various take-aways from the story, and how that can be applied for the audience.
