Imposters, Value, and a Different Kind of Perspective

ABSTRACT:

Your community sympathizes, you lean in and try to calm down, but is there anything you can learn from walking with and out of your imposter syndrome? I invite you on a journey to look with curiosity and consider what it means to be an imposter and what it means to belong.

TO THE ORGANIZERS:
Hi, I am excited to submit my cfp to your talk - in my college community, a large number of students have an unspoken belief that they do not belong. And not only do they not belong, that they are not enough. And its a real problem; I have met students that do not apply for jobs or learn new things, because they do not think they deserve it. Our industry is missing qualified, bright technologists because of these beliefs. I know two students who are officers in organizations, have had multiple internships and lie on their resumes because they are still not good enough. From my two internships in industry, I have found professionals to suffer seriously as well. 

Most talks on this subject center on the point that everyone feels this way, and people should deny this feeling because it is simply not true. In my talk I want to share my experience in the last year from spending every day at work believing my company should have hired someone else to understanding the value that I bring my organization, and help members of the audience understand more about themselves and the epidemic that is imposter syndrome.
