Definition:
	current:
		My community is students who are learning and succeeding at computer science and tech theory, but have much less confidence in practical applications. I frequently hear people talk about ideas they have and never implement them, and know many people who experience imposter syndrome and believe that it is the truth.

	ideal:
		An ideal community would be those same students connected to each other and inspiring and helping each other to learn how to make the things they talk about and see other students make. It would create positivity and support, and people will see that they are able to help other students and add value, and are far from the imposter they feel like they are.

	ideas:
		I think a big secret is entry level workshops: I held one last year with a friend teaching people how to make a flask app that called twilio, and about fifty people showed up and learned how to make something. They saw that there was really nothing hard about using an api, and got to learn how easy it is to learn.

		The video in the module talked about how a community is about introducing people to other people too, and that factor would greatly help. People would be able to support each other and learn from each other in an engaged way.

Size:
	current:
		(I go to a big school) there are about maybe 100 students across the grade levels who go to computer science events and are involved in trying to learn practical computer science.

	ideal:
		I confess I am not sure what the ideal size is, the bigger the group the harder it is to keep the community agile. But if people are engaged with each other, it can still seem small and be a close knit community. I like the current size because people have skills in different areas (web, security) and diverse workshops can be done.

		The group has become bigger, since our hackathon club started. This community is bigger than the hackathon club started, because anyone can attend workshops and the hackathon. But interest and availability of accessible learning opportunities has increased the size.

Accessibility:
	Accessibility increased last year, because last year was the first year students ran workshops to teach people how to make things at an entry level. Before that it was harder to learn, because clubs only invitd company representatives or people to give high level theory talks. Still, there is only a really crowded workshop about three times a semester.

	Meetings are invariably held at night, usually at 7pm, so if someone cannot make that time on weekday they are effectively disconnected from the group. There is no childcare or anything for the events.

Interests:
	The community is not completely computer science majors, there are engineers, friends of computer science majors, and computer science minors. I like this diversity, and think it also represents how you don't learn how to create anndroid applications or set up arduinos in class anyway, so there is a room with lots of noobs.

	Our community is pretty specific to wanting to learn how to build things ourselves, but this itself is diverse covering hardware, web apis, making chatter bots. I'm planning a workshop on intregrating an app and a database. 

Goals:
	People get involved because they want to know how to do things; I am sure some are interested because it will make them more employable, and some because it is fun. Or they just want to hang out with a bunch of nerds. 

	I think most people want a degree, but we have never done any sessions on particular homework or anything.

	It is very likely people are trying to ramp up to get a job, but there are enough people making silly and fun and completely personal things that the tone of the group does not feel like a job-hunting support group.

	Yes, there is a lot of passion when people get past the initial "I can't do this, how do some people just know how to make things."

	A new goal is to address imposter syndrome in the way it hurts students from learning how to make things and just learning new things in general. This really is a major barrier at my school.

Location:
	We meet on campus, in persion most often put also have a facebook group. There is free parking and a free bus system, so one and off campus students have access to our space which is free for us to use. It is a pretty flexible space, but is hard to fit sizes of over fifty at a time. There are pretty decent desks there, but we do need to be better about food and water, the hackathon club does have a budget and could probably provide something at every workshop.

Communicaton:
	We get in touch with each other through our facebook group and us organizers have a slack channel. I wonder if maybe we should make a github organization, but we are such a big group it would probably be annoying to keep track of that many people, especially if you just join.

Culture:
	Our community is definitely welcoming to new people and new ideas. At one of my first meetings there was something I thought about saying and then I changed my mind, and one of the founders told me that if I had an opinion I had to share it.

	If there is a disagreement, especially in the officer team, we debate until it is resolved. It's an interesting process. We are probably going to have to change it as we grow and get new people.

	I am not sure if we have any formal procedures and policies in place. We typically abide by the mlh code of conduct.

	Personally I always try to get people to treat each other with respect and then facilitate the coming to a consensus.
