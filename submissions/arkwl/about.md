Hello Everyone! 

I am Alexa Rockwell, Stony Brook's soon to be GitHub Campus Expert! I love flowers, name any sort and I might have them in my garden.

When I'm not tending to my 40 different rose bushes ðŸŒ¹, I'm a full stack developer, Major League Hacking Coach, and fitness/wellness enthusiast.
