Hello there!

I'm Borja Leiva, the spanish guy who talks a lot! ðŸ˜œ
Second year CS Student at Uni of Sheffield and president of HackSheffield and I try to be around almost every tech community I find! 

If you already know me I'm sure you know how friendly and open to be part of new communities and meet new people I am, if not, say hello cause I'd love to meet you!
Heard about Campus Expert Program at #HackConEU and got hooked! 
Can't wait to be part of this!
