### Definition
- Currently:
    - Women in Computing at RIT
    - This organization is made up of students, staff, and alumni that are passionate about fostering a diverse and accepting environment for women in computing.

- Ideal:
    -  I'd like us to reach out and form relationships with other diversity based organizations within the RIT community. By combining efforts we can accomplish even more!

### Size
- Currently:
    - Current our organization has around 40 active members

- Ideal:
    - I would like as many people to be a part of the community as possible! The larger the organization is the more that we can do to help others. 
    - From the time the organization started to two years ago there were around ten or so active members. There was a huge spike in this when there was a new full time director hired. At this time we also recieved a class room inside of the computing college building to serve as a social space and head quarters for planning our main events. 

### Resources
- Currently:
    - Currently we have a few tech talks each semester that are given by visiting companies. There is also a projects committee, however it is struggling for a clear sense of purpose and direction. 
    - We have weekly meetings and a hackathon, WicHacks.

- Ideal:
    - I'd like to revamp our projects commitee. Currently there is a lack of technical development available. By providing this, members can gain extra skills as well as confidence to help pass challenging courses at RIT. 
    - I'd like to have weekly project based technical meetings, as well as our normal weekly update meetings with some sort talk. A lot of our members do attend WicHacks, but it would be cool to attend another hackathon as a group. 

### Accessibility
- Currently:
    - If you do not live on campus then attending each meeting may be difficult. However we do post the slides from weekly meetings on our Facebook group. 
    - College students have a wide range of work hours, and some of our members coop/intern in different time zones so it is likely that our meetings Wednesday's at 6:30PM could be during someones work. 
    - RIT has a child care services (paid), WiC does not provide child care. 

- Ideal:
    - I'm not sure how this could be improved upon, and I'm not sure what would be an ideal situation for this. Maybe making it known that interpreters are available on request. 

### Interests
- Currently:
    - Our community is made up mostly of computing students within RIT college of computing information science (GCCIS). That includes a wide range of majors such as CS, SE, IT, Security, HCI, Game Design and Development. In recent years we have gained more members from different majors including MIS which is in the business college. We plan on reaching out to involve the XD and design community at RIT.
    - Open to any topic! Thats the best part. Everyone comes together because they enjoy being apart of a community and giving back to further the future of women in computing fields.
