Hi! My name is Shannon McIntosh and I'm a fourth year Software Engineer at RIT. I've worked for Microsoft, HubSpot, and Intuit. Within the RIT community I do a lot of volunteering for our Women in Computing organization.

I'm originally from upstate NY and have lived in Deleware, Seattle, Boston, and San Jose.
I enjoy hiking, and have gotten in to backpacking recently.

If you want to learn about maple syruping hit me up!
