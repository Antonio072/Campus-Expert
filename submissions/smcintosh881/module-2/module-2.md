### Nature of the incident: Another Community

For this interaction I've chosen a community that I am not a member of but have had some interaction with as a member. For this incident it was a group of well meaning people. This incident took place over a community Slack channel for an academic organization. There was a private channel dedicated to helping underage members find alcohol or parties. The moderator of the Slack was not aware that this private channel had been created but was told by a community member outside of Slack that it was occurring. 

### Moderation action

The moderators first response aligns closely with how you should handle Trolls. They issued a statement on behalf of the organization that underage drinking was not legal and violated terms of being involved with the organization. The group of students then proceeded to make another private channel where they complained about and made fun of other members including the moderator. When this was found out those members were asked to leave the Slack for violating policy. 

### Outcome

The channels were removed and the students no longer used that form of communication for non organization specific uses. I'm not sure what could have gone differently as this behavior was breaking organization policy and needed to be handled strictly. This resulted as a positive for the community as members no longer felt uncomfortable with the private partying channels and and the party culture that was not inline with the communities goals.

### What could be different?

I'm not anything could have been done differently. It was important to express and remind members that were not involved that this is unacceptable behavior, as well as let those involved know that they needed to stop immediately.  


### Nature of the incident: My Community

When our community hosts events we used to use a GroupMe to keep everyone in contact. We had an incident where a volunteer had unknowingly matched with a perspective student on a dating app, and once they found out had posted about it in the GroupMe. This upset some people in the GroupMe and others found it entertaining. 

### Moderation action

The first thing we did was have the student remove the screen shots from the public group me, and let the other members in the GroupMe know that the situation was going to be looked into and evaluated to make sure on going decisions were informed and no code of conduct rules were broken. We had a panel hearing from the student so they could inform us about what had happened. This follows the form Conflict & Awareness. We listened to the situation, saw why some students were upset, and were able to proceed with handling it from there. 

### Outcome

The messages were removed from the GroupMe, and those involved with the incident apologized. We also updated our code of conduct rules for volunteer at events that prevent students from using dating apps whilst volunteering. This has worked as no other incidents such as this have occurred. 

### What could be different?

I had a strong no tolerance approach to the matter and wanted the member who had unknowingly done something that could have caused trouble to be removed from the organization or withdraw from their position. However, the other committee members were much better at moderating the situation than I was. They handled it calmly and thought every step out. Together we came to a decision that worked best for our community and its members.
