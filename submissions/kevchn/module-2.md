## Task

### Analyse a community you do not manage.

To analyse a community you do not manage will require finding a _visible_ moderation action. Some moderation actions aren't easily visible to viewers after the fact, for example, if a thread is deleted. You may recall some visible techniques from Lee's talk, such as _extinction_.

### Analyse a community you manage.

If it is a community you manage, you can analyse one of your own past moderation actions, in light of the contents of this module.

Some prompts may be:
- Did I use the right tool to resolve this conflict?
- Was the outcome the outcome I wanted?
- What could have improved the outcome?

## Completing the exercise

Write your analysis following the below headings:

### Nature of the incident

Last semester, I organized a beginner's tech talk for my school to teach students to develop an interactive personal website. The speaker was a friend that I met through class, and I helped him develop the slide deck such that it would be easy for a non-CS student to follow along.

During the tech talk, Student A had issues getting his Javascript environment set up, and the student next to him started harassing Student A.

### Moderation action

First, I went over to the pair of students to figure out the reason for the disturbance. I saw that Student A had trouble setting up the environment, and tried to quickly resolve his problem. Once I finished however, the other student continued to harass Student A, calling him 'stupid' and other more profane words.  One of my fellow organizers then came over to tell the offending student that while he knew it could be difficult to wait for others, everyone worked at their own pace, and that it was important to be patient. My fellow organizer tried to use blending to defuse the situation.

When this did not work however, the offending student continued to make snide remarks, causing the entire audience began to look up from their computers to look at the disturbance. The student speaker noticed what was occurring, and decided to stop speaking. Instead, he stared patiently at the offending student, using the technique called 'Extinction' in order to get the student to stop.

### Outcome

The outcome of the moderation was that Student A was no longer harassed throughout the talk, and managed to get his website up and running. He came after the talk to thank us for our help (with both the website and getting the other student to stop harassing him).

However, the other student continued to come to our tech talks, and in several instances continued his behavior with several other students. After he several reports, we finally blacklisted him from all further talks.

### What could be different?

Based on what I learned from this module, I believe I should have banned the student sooner. I also should have notified an administrator by filing a report immediately after the first offense. Two counts of bullying another student should be enough to permanently ban a student from coming to our events. Our events should be a safe space for everyone, and one student should not have the chance to ruin it for others.
