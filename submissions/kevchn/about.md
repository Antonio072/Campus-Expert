# About Kevin

Hi! My name is Kevin Chen and I'm the Director of Travel at Bitcamp at the University of Maryland! In addition to Bitcamp, I also organize biweekly tech talks as part of Terrapin Hackers-- one of our university's largest CS clubs-- and also direct Design for our school's VR club.

## Interests

My technical interests include functional programming (scala/cats, motion, ocaml) and deep learning. I also love filmmaking, writing, and working with entrepreneurially minded people.
