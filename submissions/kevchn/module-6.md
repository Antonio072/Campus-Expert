# Sponsorship Prospectus

by Kevin Chen

## Definition

I am raising funds for a community, Machine Learning at Maryland. These funds will be used to support machine-learning projects, talks/workshops, and development of a distributed sensor network and IoT AI on the Edge lab.

## Budget

$1500 for initial setup (and another 1100 for each additional GPU unit, to be scaled with number of members, classes, etc). Most pieces ship within one week, apparel needs three weeks to ship.

### Need

- GPU Training for In-Person Workshops/Demos/Projects
  - **External GPU enclosure ($300)**
  - **Nvidia 1080TI GPU ($800)**
- GPU Training for Remote Projects
  - Access to supercomputing cluster for research (Free)
- Sensor Network
  - **Gateways ($10-30)**
    - ESP8266 WiFi Module + MQTT
    - Raspberry Pi
  - **Sensors and Actuators ($10-20)**
    - Arduino
    - Sonoff

### Nice to Have

- Display for In-Person Workshops/Demos/Projects
  - **TV for In-Person Demos/Workshops ($500)**
- GPU Training for Remote Projects
  - Cloud credit (ex: GCP) for non-research projects
- Other
  - **Club branded apparel ($10-50)**
  - **Food for 50-person events ($250-500)**
    - Papa John's University Agreement
    - Chick Fil A University Agreement

## Tiers

## Usability

A sponsor can quickly find what they need from the tier list, however **there needs to be more detailed descriptions** of each item somewhere. (Right now this is all described in detail during phone calls to sponsors)

Companies that have more specific requirements need more custom proposals.

- Companies recruiting for research internships (e.g Microsoft Research, Google DeepMind)
  - They want to find and recruit talented ML Grad Students
  - We need to attract top ML Grad Students to join, provide resumes, and allow recruiting events/materials
- Companies wanting developers to use their hardware (e.g Nvidia, Akitio, Amazon Echo)
  - They want developers to use their hardware
  - We need to encourage high-visibility student projects that make extensive use of sponsor hardware
- Companies wanting developers to use their APIs (e.g IBM Watson)
  - They want developers to use their APIs
  - We need to encourage high-visibility student projects that make extensive use of sponsor APIs 
- Companies looking for industry software engineering/ML interns (e.g CapitalOne)
  - They want to recruit CS Undergraduate Students
  - We need to attract top CS students to join, highlight the Software Engineering aspects of our projects, provide resumes, and allow recruiting events/materials
