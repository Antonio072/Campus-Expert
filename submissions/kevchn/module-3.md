# Talk Proposal

by Kevin Chen

Virtual reality is one of the fastest growing fields in tech, but creating a VR application takes resources that most students simply don't have. The cost of paying for a Rift, a Unity Pro license, and a high-end computer is easily out of reach for most students today. As a result, young developers interested in VR without access to high-end hardware are at a disadvantage in comparison to their more privileged peers. During this talk, we'll take a look at WebVR, a web standard that will allow any developer to write a VR app in the browser. By the end, you'll see how anyone with just a low-spec computer and phone can become a VR developer.
