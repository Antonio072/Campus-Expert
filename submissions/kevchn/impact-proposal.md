# Community Impact Proposal
by Kevin Chen

## Summary of the Community's Needs
The community assessment constructed a framework with which we can evaluate (1) the state of the UMD community, (2) the needs of the UMD community as a whole, (3) the need for a specific organization-- Machine Learning at Maryland, (4) what areas we need this new organization needs to focus on.
### Community Demographics
We are targeting a subset of the UMD CS population that is interested in machine-learning (200-300 initially, could expand to 1000+), out of a total CS population of 3000+. We want to reach a variety of students/faculty from different fields (e.g Engineering, Science, Art, Business, etc).
### Communication
Our community prefers to communicate through Email, Slack and Facebook Messenger. Official meetings are held in person when possible (especially when discussing issues that require the help of many members).
### Culture
Our university is home to a number of thriving CS organizations, and the student body is extremely excited for an organization that is dedicated to machine-learning. Many student leaders from other organizations are teaming up to lead Machine Learning at Maryland to ensure that the club can stay true to its vision.

## Proposal

I will start a program that matches student members of Machine Learning at Maryland with machine-learning projects sourced from both academia and industry.

### Timing

The best timing for the start of this program is the very start of the Fall semester, when many students begin their undergraduate or graduate research assistantships. Ideally, the program should be ready and available to students by the first day of move-in.

### Community Demographics

While we are focused on targeting any students interested in machine-learning, we would like to especially focus on those with a research background to kick off our first projects, in order to make sure our projects are of a quality that properly represents the University, and to create future mentors for projects that will start in the Winter.

In addition, we will work with minority student group leaders (such as Girls Who Code) to create projects that will increase the visibility of diversity groups campus-wide.

### Goals

The University of Maryland has many generalized CS clubs, but none with the specific focus of addressing the needs of our. machine-learning community. Our goal for this project is to foster a healthy machine-learning program where students can learn through experience in a fun and engaging way. Students will gain the confidence and resume experience to pursue further education in machine-learning through higher-level research, internships, or graduate school.

### Communication

For each machine-learning project and team, small slack groups and google-site wikis will be the centerpoints of communication and documentation. Second, there will also be one slack group for all students involved in all machine-learning projects, where general announcements and information-sharing can occur. Third, there will be also be a Facebook group for all members, so that students that are not in a project will be able to read up on existing projects, and potentially find projects to join. Finally, there will be a few, small Facebook messenger groups where student leaders will communicate with professors and sponsors to elucidate goals for the program.

## Proposal Impact
### Target Audience

I plan to impact all people (students, mostly) in the Maryland community who are interested in machine-learning, at both the beginner and advanced level (but primarily at the advanced level for the first few months)

### Community Needs

I am addressing the lack of a machine-learning community at Maryland that is aimed at the experiential development of machine-learning skills in undergraduate students, as well as the lack of collaboration/sharing amongst graduate students.

### Resources
University cluster access (to provide GPUs for training), an external GPU for demos and workshops, and a room where we can hold events. 

We are reaching out to companies and university departments to secure sponsorships to gain access to GPU resources for model-training (hardware or cloud credits). I am hoping to apply for the Github grant to help seed funding for the club. 

We have agained university permission to access a supercomputing cluster for at least one project (the exploration of the loss function in neural nets), and are looking to request access for more projects. We have also secured a room that can house the first batch of students (30+) for meetings, and are in the process of securing a much larger space (80+).

*Optional:* We are looking to find companies willing to sponsor specific  projects, in order to attract students who may not have the financial means to otherwise spend free time to work on a project (e.g. low-income students who have to work several jobs to pay for tuition).

### Media

I have delivered my community impact proposal to several CS undergraduate organization student leaders and CS professors, and plan to reach out to the CS undegraduate administration to schedule a meeting to discuss the formal details of the plan. 

This would consist of me preparing a keynote and a set of detailed handouts regarding the plan and how the program would aid the University in its goals (visibility, increased applications/attrition etc). I can adapt many of the points I have made in this proposal and my community assessment.

### Content Knowledge

I have leadership experience in several student CS organizations on campus (Bitcamp, umdVR, Terrapin Hackers). I have taken an introductory machine-learning course (UW), two deep-learning courses (Stanford CS231n, CS224d), and have conducted machine-learning research for a little over a year.

#### Knowledge of participant needs

As the lead organizer of student-led CS tech talks at my university, many students have told me what they are looking for when they attend our talks (e.g what they enjoy/ what could be improved/ what topics they want). 

### Timeline

By the week before the start of the semester, I will have written up descriptions for three initial projects that our club will embark on.

A few days before the start of the semester, I will meet with a group of machine-learning professors and the initial student-board of the Machine Learning at Maryland organization to figure out how to best structure the marketing and organization of the projects.

At the start of the semester, I will open up a web portal to allow students to register for projects and/or submit a proposal for their own.

After the first week of the semester, I will organize a group meeting where students can meet/discuss new projects in person. The semester's first projects and their student groups will be formalized at this meeting.

By the 10-week mark of the projects, students will be given the opportunity to submit a white-paper to the group, and there will be a quick paper-review over lunch hosted by the club.

At the end of the semester, groups will present their projects in front of the club and a panel of professors and industry professionals. Recognition and awards will be given out to all those who completed the program.

## Planning for the Future

I will review the impact of the proposal after the Fall semester, during winter break. This will allow me and the other leaders of the organization to figure out the best way to adjust and prepare for the new set of projects during the Spring semester.

I will measure success by the feedback of the professors/industry professionals overseeing the projects, the feedback of the students, the number of projects/students in the program, and the diversity of students and student interests reached during the program.

We will perform minor iterations (e.g moving dates and project details around) during every weekly club meeting. We will perform major iterations (restructuring how the program works, adding a new sponsored project) every 10 weeks.
