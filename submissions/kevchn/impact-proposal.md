# Community Impact Proposal
by Kevin Chen

## Summary of the Community's Needs
The community assessment constructed a framework with which we can evaluate (1) the state of the UMD community, (2) the needs of the UMD community as a whole, (3) the need for a specific organization-- Machine Learning at Maryland, (4) what areas we need this new organization needs to focus on.
### Community Demographics
We are targeting a subset of the UMD CS population that is interested in machine-learning (200-300 initially, could expand to 1000+), out of a total CS population of 3000+. We want to reach a variety of students/faculty from different fields (e.g Engineering, Science, Art, Business, etc).
### Communication
Our community prefers to communicate through Email, Slack and Facebook Messenger. Official meetings are held in person when possible (especially when discussing issues that require the help of many members).
### Culture
Our university is home to a number of thriving CS organizations, and the student body is extremely excited for an organization that is dedicated to machine-learning. Many student leaders from other organizations are teaming up to lead Machine Learning at Maryland to ensure that the club can stay true to its vision.
