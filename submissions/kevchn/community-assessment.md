# Assessing Your Community's Needs
By Kevin Chen

## Definition
Students (undergraduate and graduate) at the University of Maryland, College Park interested in forming a community to collaborate on machine-learning research, workshops/talks, and projects.

## Size
35 students (officers) and 3 professors are officially on the Machine Learning at Maryland Club SGA roster.

We have not officially launched, and our first General Body Meeting, when membership will be open to everyone, will held be this fall.

We would like 200-300 students and 20 profesors to be a part of Machine Learning at Maryland by the end of the academic year. I came to this number through extrapolating from first-year numbers from other successful CS clubs at my university, such as Bitcamp, VR Club, and Terrapin Hackers, which all now have 300+ members.

## Resources
### Classes
Currently there are two machine-learning related undergraduate courses at our university: (CMSC421) Artificial Intelligence and (CMSC422) Machine Learning. However, these courses require taking CMSC131-132-216-250-330-351, a sequence of classes which takes 2+ years. In addition, in a school with over 3000 CS undergraduate students, there are only 255 available spots in these machine-learning classes.

As a result, only a very small fraction of students interested in Machine Learning at our university are able to currently gain experience with it.

### Workshops
I organize technical talks for one a CS club at our university that organizes travel to other hackathons, Terrapin Hackers. These talks range anywhere from beginner-level web development topics at the beginning of the year to cursory machine-learning talks toward the end of the year.

There are often 30-80 students at each of the workshops (we had  18 last year).

The problem with more advanced workshops is that there is no venue for more specific marketing, which leads to beginners attending workshops that are too advanced, and more advanced students attending workshops that are too elementary. Workshops by Terrapin Hackers should be kept to more general topics and workshops that are more advanced should be taught by individual clubs.

### Hackathons
The biggest hackathon at our university is Bitcamp, which is MLH's largest Spring hackathon, with over 1300 attendees. We also have Technica, which is the largest women's hackathon in the United States.

There are also a number of emerging smaller hackathons, such as RealityHacks (by the VR Club), and Equals Equals (a hackathon focused on diversity).

### Other Resources
The university also has	:

- Career fairs
- Startup competitions
- Mobile developer club
- Augmented reality club
- Cybersecurity club
- ACM ICPC
- CS Latino Group

There is no machine-learning or artificial intelligence organization at the University of Maryland.

### Accessibility
Most clubs meet at CSIC, the Computer Science Instructional Center. Club meetings are usually on the weekdays anytime from 6pm-12am. Bitcamp meets at Startup Shell, an on-campus nonprofit student startup incubator.

### Interests
Our community is currently made up of mostly CS students/faculty (95%+). While we would like to have students with backgrounds that allow them to work on machine-learning projects (e.g Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Mathematics majors), we are also seeking students and professors who can (1) provide a unique perspective on our projects (e.g Government and Policy students helping figure out how to best anonymize the data from our sensor streaming project) or (2) students who are interested in using basic models to try out applied machine-learning in their areas (e.g Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Sociology, etc).

We currently have 1 policy professor and 1 biochemistry professor-student pair in our club who have projects that align to the goals outlined above.

Our club has a focus on deep-learning, but is also interested in classical machine learning, big data (Spark/Impala), functional programming (Scala cats, Haskell, Motion ocaml), and other areas that go well with machine-learning (and do not have separate organizations on campus dedicated to their study).

### Goals
Machine learning is one of the sought-after topics at the University of Maryland. Not only have many professors have communicated the desire for further machine-learning organization to encourage collaboration, but hordes of students have approached me after technical workshops, talks, and events asking if we have any machine-learning events coming up.

Many lower-level undergraduate students are passionate about learning a world-changing technology that they have little opportunity to interact with in school.

Upper-level undergraduate students who want to get into graduate school want to improve their resume with machine-learning projects and research.

Graduate students want to be exposed to advanced workshops/talks that are typically not held by general CS clubs at university. In addition, they want to accelerate their research, and networking with fellow students/professors is a good way to do so.

Our goal is to establish a culture where any student can learn about machine learning (through talks and workshops), collaborate with others on academia or industry-sponsored projects, and share their findings and experiences with others.

### Location
Our location currently will gather at Sandbox, a hackerspace at our university located in CSIC. There are campuses buses that go to this building all-day 7 days a week. We are allowed to use this space for free, with special permission from the professor that created and currently manages it. It can currently hold 30+ students. For larger meetings, we have permission to sign up for timeslots in the lower level of CSIC, which can hold 80+ students.

There are water fountains in the building and a food court less than a quarter of a mile away.

I am currently attempting to arrange for a larger space in the Jeong H. Kim engineering building to house 100+ students at a time. (This will require significant funding to furnish the space such that the University is convinced to allot us the space indefinitely).

### Communication
Our group communicates formally with other groups and professors through email. Internally, we use Slack for the entire group, and Facebook Messenger for one-off events.

### Culture
Our community is welcoming to any new student passionate about machine-learning, regardless of their expertise or current domain. We have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind, and any students who demonstrate such behavior are banned from the organization. I will personally handle any accounts of such behavior and ensure that all members feel that our organization is a safe space for all denominations.

We currently have a constitution and member policy officially recognized by the University of Maryland.
