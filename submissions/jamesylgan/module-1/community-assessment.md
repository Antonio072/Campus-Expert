# Definition
- How would you define your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:
  * My community is a school which serves some of the highest achieving students in the country studying Computer Science.

  * An ideal version of my community would be one where there are more avenues of support for students from different fields or less experienced backgrounds to get involved.

  * I hope to partner with organizations on campus to create event offerings which provide guidance, instruction, and mentorship to more beginners and students from other fields.

# Size
- How many people are currently in your community?
  * The community is roughly 1100 students and 150 faculty.
  * https://www.cs.cornell.edu/information/about
  * https://www.infosci.cornell.edu/about-us/history
- How many would you _like_ to be in your community?
  * The full size of Cornell University, roughly 25,000. Realistically, I hope to bring a few hundreds of students into tech-oriented events.
- Historically, has the group always been about the same size? If not, what brought on that change?
  * It has not. The Computer Science major has been growing rapidly as the industry has become more popular, with the Computer Science department expanding their staff every year. Furthermore, the Information Science department is relatively new, having its first undergraduates in 2005

I am not completely sure how to answer these for an ideal version of my community- I do not wish to say that everyone should be a Computer Science student, and the second question allowed me to share my hopes for growing the community. I plan on partnering with: tech groups such as BigRedHacks, Women in Computing at Cornell, and Entrepreneurship at Cornell; business groups like Student Agencies and Business Fraternities; and diversity and new student groups such as Let's Get Coffee, BEARS, and the Cornell University Multicultural Greek Letter Council, in order to reach a wider range of students outside of Computer Science and related majors.

# Resources
### Answers to these questions for current community

- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  * There are currently a limited number of ways to learn about tech:
  1. High level tech workshops
  2. Hackathons with no beginner support
  3. Computer science classes - the first of which are fast paced and difficult, speaking from experience (and the fact that many people who take the intro and object oriented classes end up dropping and quitting computer science).
  4. A limited number of clubs, namely WICC (https://wicc.acm.org/), URMC, and ACSU, (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/ugroups) which do not often host beginner events.
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
  * There are a small number of meetups, resources through classes, one data science seminar that requires prior knowledge, and BigRedHacks (which does not provide beginner support).
  
### Answers to these questions for an ideal version of your current community
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  * Workshops for beginner tech skills
  * Mentorship programs available to any interested student
  * More experienced level support: already exists
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
  * Yes, including meetups and seminars for beginners on a range of topics, more resources for beginners online, office hours for beginners to learn from experienced students and staff, and a beginner hackathon.

### Ideas on how to improve in each category
- What is currently available to people in your community to learn about tech?
  * Host and find others to host workshops on popular languages, basic concepts, overviews of the industry, how to suceed in the industry
  * Create mentorship programs for other fields: for example, we could create a program for each college (we have quite a few) at Cornell so that we reach every field of study, as well as a freshman outreach program
- Are there meetups, seminars, online tools, office hours, hackathons?
  * Create more meetups and seminars such as with MLH Localhost to cater to beginners
  * Work with existing experienced-level groups such as the ACSU to develop beginner-friendly online tools and office hours
  * Work with BigRedHacks, URMC, and WICC to create a hackathon for beginners.

# Accessibility
### Answers to these questions for current community

- How accessible are the current resources in your community?
  * Virtually all the meetings are held in the engineering quad - somewhere that only engineers tend to go to.
- Are meetings held during hours where people may be working?
  * Not really, student organizations generally hold meetings after the time classes generally end.
- Is there childcare available?
  * Yes! But it is far away and costs money (naturally) https://hr.cornell.edu/wellbeing-perks/parenting/cornell-child-care-center


### Answers to these questions for an ideal version of your current community
* In an ideal version of my community, meetings would be held across the entire campus, particularly around the collegetown area where many business students live off-campus, as well as north campus where freshmen are required to live. Timing is not the largest issue, as long as people will dedicate the time. I am not sure we could offer childcare.

### Ideas on how to improve in each category
* Many lower income students and students from far away stay on campus over breaks, and it would be spectacular to help get them interested and learning more about tech during those breaks.
* Host a wider range of events throughout the campus, and expand current event offerings to additional locations such as West campus, Ehub in Collegetown, and RPCC on North campus.
* We could potentially secure funding to help reimburse the costs of Cornell's childcare, but would have to do a needs assessment of interested parties first - probably focused around graduate students.

# Interests

### Answers to these questions for current community
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
  * It is! I am not okay with it, and hope to change that.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  * It varies! We are a large campus and I hope to affect a wide range of people. Traditionally, however, interests tend to be specific towards tech related topics.

### Answers to these questions for an ideal version of your current community
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
  * No! The community is made up of people learning about tech, beginnners, entrepreneurs, computer science students, and everything in between.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  * Yes! They will come from a large variety of backgrounds and either want to work in tech or implement tech into their professional and personal lives.

### Ideas on how to improve in each category
- Is your community made up only of computer science students? Are you OK with that?
  * I detailed some of this above, but I hope to expand the tech community by having beginner friendly events targeted at new students and students from different areas.
- Is your community open to other topics, or are their interests very specific?
  * By expanding the tech community in the manner stated above, we would get students from different colleges, majors, and backgrounds and expand the interests of the community.

# Goals

### Answers to these questions for current community
- Why do people get involved in your community?
  * Pre-existing interest in technology, prior coursework in computer science, pursuit of high salaries
- Are they students hoping to get a degree?
  * In over 90% of cases, they do, so yes.
- Are they trying to ramp-up to get a job?
  * In most cases, yes.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  * It depends - many people are doing it more in the pursuit of a high salary as opposed to passion about developing, so only some are.
  ### not sure what to answer here re: goals. My community is large.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  * Most of them already exist: hackathons, experienced-level learning activities, high level courses, and on campus recruiting as one of the best engineering schools and computer science programs in the world.

### Answers to these questions for an ideal version of your current community
- Why do people get involved in your community?
  * They see technology playing a large role in the future, and hope to learn to compete and contribute within that future.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  * Yes! I hope that everyone getting involved would be passionate about developing or the developing process, whether or not they are actually doing the coding.
  ### not sure what to answer here re: goals. My community is large.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  * Attend as many activities as possible and learn as much as possible.

### Ideas on how to improve in each category
- Why do people get involved in your community?
  * Expand beyond computer science majors by running beginner and out-of-technology friendly outreach programs.
- Are they passionate about developing, regardless of their major?
  * Run more activities and programs to help people get passionate about technology
  ### not sure what to answer here re: goals. My community is large.
- What activities and goals can you set for your community based on their existing goals?
  * Improve activity and program offerings to be more friendly to a more diverse range of people.


# Location
- Where does your community currently gather?
- Is it an online-only group so far, or is there a place where people can meet?
- Is there parking, and if so, is it free?
- Is there public transportation available to and from meet-ups?
- Is the location accessible to those both on and off campus?
- How much does it cost to use the space?
- How flexible is the space for different types of presentations and meetings?
- How many people can it fit?
- Is there comfortable seating for all shapes and sizes?
- Is there water or snacks available nearby?

### Answers to these questions for current community
* The community currently gathers in the engineering school at my campus. Some subgroups, such at the URMC group, are online-only. Most students live on or near campus, and will be able to get to meetings the same way they get to class, but it is a fairly long walk to unfamiliar buildings for most non-engineering students. The cost of space is free, for students, and most buildings have rooms which will fit different kinds of presentations - ranging from small and intimate to large with lots of tech re: microphones and projectors. Seating is the same as what students do for classes, so it is generally familiar. Water and snacks are available through vending machines fairly hidden in the basement in one building to on campus eateries that are not frequented by non-engineers, to on campus or off campus eateries that are far away.

### Answers to these questions for an ideal version of your current community
* The community gathers around the entire campus, centered around collegetown, west campus, north campus, and central campus. Subgroups are encouraged and assisted with running more on-campus events so that members of the community have regular access to diverse activities in many different settings. Students are able to become familiar with tech at familiar locations, and then are encouraged to go beyond and attend activities at less familiar locations over time.

### Ideas on how to improve in each category
* Grow the community and the level of support by expanding activity offerings regularly into new locations.

# Communication
- How does your community get in touch with one another?
- Is there an email group, a GitHub organization, a Twitter account, a Facebook group, a chat room or channel?
- Could your organization benefit from one or more of those, or another way of communicating?

### Answers to these questions for current community
* The community gets in touch with each other through a handful of CS-related Facebook groups, newsletters, and private slack groups. Some have web sites, but most are limited to Facebook groups, newsletters, and  private chats. These communities have limited outreach outside of their groups, making it daunting and difficult to learn about the communities from the outside.

### Answers to these questions for an ideal version of your current community
* The community does regular outreach to new students and students in other colleges by having activites advertised outside of the regular circles.

### Ideas on how to improve in each category
* Reach out to other student groups about including advertisements for events in their newsletters, including the campus-wide activity newsletter sent by administration.
* Put up posters throughout the campus.
* Speak to various classes outside of CS.


# Culture
- How welcoming is your community to new people and new ideas?
- What happens if there is a disagreement?
- Are there any policies or procedures in place, and are they documented?
- How will you personally handle it?

### Answers to these questions for current community
* The current culture is not very welcoming to new people and new ideas: there is an emphasis on inside jokes, high-level subject matter, and traditional technology roles. Recent disagreements have blown up, including Facebook posts which have led to women in technology at Cornell being harassed. There are few policies in place which actually get enacted: campus-wide behavior policies tend not to apply to online interactions.

### Answers to these questions for an ideal version of your current community
* The culture is extremely welcoming to new people and new ideas: we emphasize constant support and mentoring to anyone who needs it. Disagreements are handled courteously and ones with the potential to lead to harassment are dealt with quickly, and reported to school administrators thoroughly. 

### Ideas on how to improve in each category
* Increase activites open to more diverse portions of the Cornell community, and expand mentoring programs.
* Enact a code of conduct for each event to discourage harassment and negative interaction.
* When the code of conduct is violated, personally document the issue and bring it to the attention of relevant parties: school judicial administrators, other school administrators, or the Cornell/Ithaca police, as required.
