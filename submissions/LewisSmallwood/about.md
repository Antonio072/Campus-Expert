# Lewis Smallwood
My name is Lewis Smallwood. I'm a student transitioning to Plymouth University from secondary school to study a BSc Computer Science course.

Predominantly, I’m an iOS developer with experience developing full stack systems. I also setup a business called [Bespoke Technology Labs](http://www.bespoketechlabs.co.uk/), where I create Bespoke software products for many different organisations of all sizes.

At the age of 14, I presented some of my software development work to Apple, and have been involved in many other activities like teaching students in secondary school, and developing online safeguarding frameworks within a local authority by chairing a subgroup of a [Local Safeguarding Children Board](http://www.northsomersetlscb.org.uk/).

My ⭐️ emoji is either a tab or a space. But most likely a ☕️.

# Organisations
As well as developing software through my business, I also worked as a developer at companies like [Sparkol](http://www.sparkol.com/) (who create [VideoScribe](http://www.videoscribe.co)), and a small internet service provider called [Triangle Networks](https://www.trianglenetworks.co.uk/).

In terms of communities, I'm hoping to run several Hackathon's within Plymouth University, and other events with focuses on sharing the best source control practices.
