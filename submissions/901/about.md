# Hello world! I'm Aditya Geria

I'm a senior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, studying Computer Science. I'm super involved with the tech community at Rutgers through our CS Club, the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists (USACS), previously as a director of HackRU (our biannual Hackathon), and as president of the Creation of Games Society (COGS). I love giving back to the community that helped me find my place at a school as big as Rutgers. I feel like the tech community gives me a second home on campus, and challenges me to grow in every possible way as a leader and a developer.

# Hobbies/interests

Just as most of you probably do, I love playing video games! My favorite game of all time is The Witcher 3, and I love other games such as Civ 5, XCOM, Battlefield, Metal Gear Solid series, and the Halo series.

Other than that, whenever I get a chance, you'd probably find me playing ping-pong in the apartment lounge, or watching soccer games. I also play guitar!

I hope to be a part of this amazing Campus Experts program, and give back to the amazing community that I'm a part of.
