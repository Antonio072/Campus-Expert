All about David:

Hi, this is David here. I am 21 years old, 3rd year Computer Science student of Rochester Institute of Technology. I am currently interning with Gartner in their subsidiary companies, Software Advice. I have also been a part of some start ups and helped developed for some companies as a freelancer. I had started participating in hackathons, which helped a lot. That is a huge reason why I'm all about student projects and the tech communities!

Hobbies:

Shout out to all the gamers! For me I love gaming, especially RPG and MMORPG. If you have any recommendations of what games I should play contact me!!! I am an avid player of League of Legends and Overwatch! But the list goes on and on, and don't worry I'm not the type of person to yell or rant about a game. Other than gaming, I am always learning about the current tech news, so if you would also like to chat with me about something, and teach me something new that is much appreciated. I always travel around the country, so if you would like to hang out or create some cool projects, then let's!!!
