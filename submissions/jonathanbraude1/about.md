# About Me
Hi friends, my name is Jonathan Braude. I am a San Francisco native, currently wrapping up my senior year at Emory Unviersity in Atlanta. 
I was an Account Management Intern at GitHub and got to work on some awesome stuff during my summer in HQ. I may not know how to code, but that's never stopped me from handling the business side :smile:.

# My Interests
I've always been facinated by innovation, as well as the way humanity's relationship with technology has changed overtime. I love engaging technology to help solve problems and help others overcome roadblocks they didn't even know were there. 
I am also passionate about promoting open source as a means of building inclusive communities.

# Regarding Emojis

Not to be redundant, but I will always be partial to :octocat:
