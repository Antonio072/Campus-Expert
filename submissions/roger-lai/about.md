# About Roger

Hi! I'm Roger and I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo, located in Canada. I'm currently not part of any active community within my school but am always looking out for opportunities to help out in whichever way I could. Currently, I'm interning as a Software Engineer at Salesforce in San Francisco, which has been an absolute blast!

# Interests

My tech interests lie within python, golang, and Infrastructure related tools. I've currently completed two other internships which have both within the infrastructure software domain. On the non-tech side, I'm a huge sports follower and support my Toronto teams!
