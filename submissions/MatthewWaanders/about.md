Hey guys! I'm Matthew Waanders and I'm a 2nd year Software Engineering student at Saxion university of applied sciences
in the Netherlands!

I'm running my own start-up with a friend of mine, Slash-IT as well as doing freelance work of my own.
I'm an avid longboarder and love everything audio related, as well as photography and of course GitHub :D
