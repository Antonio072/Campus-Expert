# About Matt

I'm a third year computer science student at University College London. I spent
time last year working with the university technology society (UCLU TechSoc) and
helping to organise their main hackathon of the year
([Porticode](https://porticode.io)), as well as volunteering/mentoring at other
hackathons around Europe.

## Interests

In terms of technology stuff, I'm a huge fan of JavaScript on both the frontend
and backend. I do loads of work with Node.JS and React, and I'm very excited
about how they will continue to evolve in the future! I also have some interest
in web security and the Internet of Things, which is slightly ironic given IoT's
reputation for being incredibly insecure...

I also enjoy running, the crazy world of brewing coffee, and terrible puns.
