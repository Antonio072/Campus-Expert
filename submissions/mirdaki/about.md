# About me

Hello all! I currently study Computer Engineering at the University of Florida (UF). There I am the proud founder of the Open Source Club, which is a project focused organization for all things open source. Myself and the club work to improve knowledged about open source and free software in the UF community as well as make awesome things. 

Other interest include photography, Dungeons and Dragons, and Star Wars (which I'm more or less obsessed with)! Unfortunately I don't have a favorite emoji. I'm more of an emoticon user :-)
