# About Pedro

Hey! My name is Pedro. Born in Brazil I moved around quite a lot spending a most of my secondary school years in Peru and finally moving to Nottingham in the UK to study Computer Science. 

I have been passioned about tech and computer science since I can remember. Right now I am president of HackSoc, the University of Nottingham programming society. My reason to run for president of the society was to be able to show people their potentials. I have seen multiple times people that have not ever considered programming, have their lives changed because they happened to try programming once and ended up falling in love with it.

# Interests

I am pretty much interested in anything related to science and technology. But recently I have been really interested on Data Science and programming languages. As a hobby I love to try different programming languages and compare them finding their weak and strong points. I am also a hackathon fanatic and I will pretty much go to as many as I can afford money and time wise.

- Favourite programming language: **CoffeeScript**
- Favourite emoji: :bug: :beetle: For all the bug fix commits out there
- Text editor of choice: Vim
