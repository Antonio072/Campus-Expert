# About me
Hi there! I am Alexis Torreblanca. I am from Mexico City, I am 21 years old, I study Computer Engineering in the National Polytechnic Institute.
Since I started my degree I join the Competitive Programming Club, is a very small club but with bunch of nerds and a lot of enthusiasm. When i was my dream was to make my own videogame
that's why i love programing.

# Interests
I am proficient in Python, Java and a bit of Elixir and Lisp. Also I'm learning Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks as a side project (I know, I'm a full time nerd).
I love basketball and I'm a big fan of the Golden State Warriors, photography, hiking and camping.
