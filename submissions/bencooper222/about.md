# About Ben

Hi! I'm Ben, a student at Vanderbilt University double majoring in Computer Science and Public Policy Studies.
When I'm not at Vanderbilt for school, I'm usually found in Chicago, bouncing between its civic tech community and bubble tea restaurants. 
## Interests
My biggest "nerdy" interests are centered around GIS and Graph Theory. My favorite languages/frameworks are Vue.js and C#. I'm very interested in education - I grade and assist classes for Art of Problem Solving and try to integrate education into my regular activites.

I play a decent amount of video games, follow politics and international affairs and love randomly digging into the stats behind basically anything from pro League of Legends to the wealth of various counties.
