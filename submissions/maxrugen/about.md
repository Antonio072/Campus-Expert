Hi, I'm Max! Currently enrolled in Business IT at TU Dresden in Germany, I switched my major to Computer Science for the upcoming semester.

### Interests
I mainly do Front End-fiddling. I'm very interested in JavaScript and Swift (did you know about [react-native-arkit](https://github.com/HippoAR/react-native-arkit)? So cool!).
