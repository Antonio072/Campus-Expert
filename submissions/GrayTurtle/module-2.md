# Community moderation case study
## Analyzing a community I do not manage
### Nature of the incident
When I was a part of the Vietnamese American Student Association at my school there was quite a bit of drama between the previous president and the current president. The previous president absolutely did not agree how the current president was running things. One day the previous president posted in the Facebook group commenting on how she disagreed with the current president's policies and said that the organization was going down hill for everyone to see.

### Moderation action
The vice president saw the post that the previous president had made to the Facebook group and immediately deleted it. This caused the previous president to lash out to the officer board of the organization and cause all sorts of trouble. Eventually, the previos president was banned from all Vietnamese American Student Association social media and meetings. The vice president possibly saw the post as hostile and did not want the community to see it. The officers' mission was to provide a friendly and welcoming community for students. However, the way the situation was handled made the problem escalate dramtically.

### Outcome
The outcome was that the previous president was essentially removed from the community and the drama ceased. It was positive for the community in that it allowed for it to move on and focus on its true mission: to facilitate cultural diversity and have a place for people to call family. There were also new policies in place that if someone has a problem with another person, they need to handle it outside of the community and put the members first. On the other hand, it was also negative because it caused a previous leader who had influence on the community to be exiled. They had good intentions, but just went too far and became an outcast.

### What could be different?
What could have been different is that the vice president could have let the previous president know that their post is going to be deleted and that the conversation can be isolated to just the board and the previous president. At that point, the board should reason with the previous president and de-escalate the situation where they can come into agreement. This could solve the conflict, rid of the drama, and the previous president would not have to be removed from the community.
