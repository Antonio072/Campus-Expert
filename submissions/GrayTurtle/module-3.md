# Talk Proposal

## Questions are more valuable than answers
Have you ever wondered how people come up creative ideas or how companies come up with new technology? Or even how people are able to manage hundreds of people in a company? I know, I get pretty jealous sometimes too. Eventually, I have come to know that these people care more about the questions that they ask than the finding the answer. Questions drive innovation and lead to more complex and interesting ideas. It is only when one asks multiple questions is when they find a creative solution to their problem. Questions can frame the situation from a different perspective and have one think outside of the box. Finding a good question to ask is essential when moving along in life, and finding the perfect question could propel one's life even further. These questions could be as simple as "what if we did X to do Y?" or even "what else can this/we do?". That second queston can invoke others to think of other questions to ask. So how will you be asking the right questions? In this talk, I'll walk you through the steps and the type of questions you should ask in certain situations in order to find the perfect answer. You will be able to craft more creative and thought-provoking questions that will push massive innovation by the end of this talk.
