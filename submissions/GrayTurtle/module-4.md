# Workshop outline
This workshop is going to be a technology I am somewhat familiar with. It will be an intro on how to develop for Amazon Alexa via MLH Localhost.
* Learning goals:
  * Understand Amazon Alexa and voice UIs
  * Set up Alexa Skills Kit
  * Build one's own skill. Using a template is optional.
* Demonstrate:
  * Show what Alexa can do through a series of examples.
  * Explain the high level of creating a skill for Alexa.
* Evaluate the audience:
  * Get a raise of hands of who is comfortable or is a beginner with Alexa.
  * Make sure the ones who have experience are doing something suited to their skill level such as creating their own skill without templates. We can also have them help out the beginners as well.
* Discussions and pairing opportunities:
  * After going through on how to make a basic skill and how to set up Alexa Skills Kit, have the participants break into pairs or groups and have them create their own skill. 
  * The other workshop organizers and I will go around to see if anyone needs help, ask questions and discuss to come up with creative applications, reiterate what we went over in the beginning at the workshop, etc.
* Participatory learning:
  * To push people to creative applications, I would ask questions such as, "what if we did X to do Y?" or "what else can we do?"
  * I would ask the same questions if they are stuck. However, these questions will be geared more towards on how to make a skill such as ,"what if we add different sample utterances?"
* Recovery points: 
  * If someone falls behind, I'll or get someone else who is experienced to sit down with them to help them catch up.
  * If someone creates a project that gets done too fast, I will ask more "what if" questions for them to build on it.
  * If someone creates a project that takes too long, encourage them to work on it after the meeting and come back next meeting with it. I or someone else will also be helping them out after the meeting as well.
  * If someone gives up or is having a hard time, I or someone experienced will sit down with them and help them achieve smaller goals until they achieve more complex goals.
* What happens afterwards:
  * To enable my participants to continue learning is to first explain even further the possibilities of what Amazon Alexa can be hacked to do. I will direct them to the resources to the bottom of this page: https://localhost.mlh.io/activities/build-with-alexa/ and also tell them that Node.js is also a good skill to learn if you want to create more complex applications with Alexa.
  * I will probably create a challenge that's not too hard for them to complete for a prize if they show it off to me in the next meeting.
  * With whatever mode of contact we decide on using, I will create a channel for them to ask questions. Otherwise, they can have my and other workshop organizers' contact information.
