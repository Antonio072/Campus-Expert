# About John
Hi! My name is John Tran. 
I go to the University of Oklahoma and I am an upcoming junior in Computer Science.
I am one of the founders & executive directors for [Hacklahoma](https://hacklahoma.org/) and the president
of OU's Student Chapter ACM!
I have been to several hackathons, and I want to build a hacker community in Oklahoma!

# Interests
Other than hacking, I love music! I have been playing guitar for about 10 years (jazz & metal) and I used to compose my own music!
