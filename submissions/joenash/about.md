# About Joe

Hi! I'm Joe, I'm the student program manager at GitHub.
I'm based in London, UK, and have been at GitHub since August 2016. Before that, I worked at Improbable and PayPal as a developer evangelist. I got my start  because of student hackathons, so student communities and their success has always been very close to my ðŸ’–.

## Interests

My tech interests orbit around Haskell and programming language theory. If you're into that or want to learn more, drop me a message, let's talk about types!
When I'm not doing tech things, I'm currently probably playing a lot of dungeons and dragons, or learning the Ukelele.

## Contacting Joe

You can reach me at joenash@github.com, or on twitter @jna_sh. I like twitter, we should twoot at eachother! I'm also on Facebook, particularly around Hackathon Hackers EU.

## What's your favourite emoji?

ðŸ’– always be sparklin'.
