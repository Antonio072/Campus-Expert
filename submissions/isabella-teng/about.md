Hi! I'm Isabella, and I'm a sophomore at Yale University studying Computer Science. 
On campus, I'm involved with Women's Leadership Initiative as a co-business manager, volunteer with Code Haven, and work as a Students Organization Consultant. Some of my hobbies include photography, designing, and hiking.
My favorite emoji is: ðŸ¤—.
