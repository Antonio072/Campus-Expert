Hello there! üëãüèΩ

My name is Teresa Ibarra, and I'm currently a Computer Science & Dance major at Harvey Mudd College. I'm hoping to foster more of a hacking community here at Mudd-- though we have hackathons, we have little love for our software developers. I'm hoping to cultivate a community of software developers to work together on side projects once a week, which is pretty similar to hackathons started.

I'm originally from San Francisco, and have interned as a software engineer at Stitch Fix, IBM Design, Slack, and Bloomberg. I've dabbled in a lot of things, but right now I'm super into full-stack development with Ruby on Rails. I'm a Code2040 Fellow, and I was invited to present my first programming project at the White House when I was 16.

I have a brown poodle named Freddy, and I'm 100% his mom. In my spare time I enjoy watching cult classic movies, getting all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ, and playing indie video games.
