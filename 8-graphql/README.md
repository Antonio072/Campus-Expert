## Introduction 👋

In this module, you'll learn about GraphQL from Fall 2016 Campus Expert, and GitHub Education intern, Wilhelm Klopp. Wilhelm delivered this workshop, along with GitHub platform engineer, Brooks Swinnerton, to the Spring 2017 cohort of campus experts.

This workshop features live examples and interactive exercises heavily, so it is recommended you watch the video. If you are unable to follow the video, the GitHub Professional Services team offer an online GraphQL training course that is a good alternative.

When following a technical workshop in the Campus Expert training, the foremost thing in your mind should be "How can I share this knowledge with my community?". As you participate in the workshops and go through the exercises, think how you can present these concepts to your own peers, and what problems these technologies might solve, that are relevant to your community.

## Exercise 📝

During the video, Wilhelm set multiple challenges for using GraphQL. The exercise for this module is to complete those challenges. You can find a written description in the exercises directory, but for full descriptions and walkthroughs of the solutions, please refer to the video.
