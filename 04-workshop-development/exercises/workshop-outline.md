# Workshop outline

This exercise is to create a plan for a 60 minute workshop. It could be a technology you are familiar with, or one that you want to learn.

## Task

Here are some elements you could include in a workshop:
- Learning goals.
  - You should state at least 3 or 4 learning goals. These are outcomes that the participants should have fulfilled by the end, such as "understanding how X technology makes Y task easier".
- Demonstrations and examples.
  - Show how the technology can be used with a series of examples.
  - Keep "Learners first" in mind: think about pacing and the order of concepts you introduce.
- Discussions and pairing opportunities.
  - Participants in workshops learn from each other, as well as from you. What opportunities can you give them to exchange and reinforce knowledge?
  - Discussions in technical workshops are particularly well suited to topics like use-cases and creative application of a technology.
  - Having participants exchange and review code, or work together on code in pairs, is an easy and valuable way to promote collaboration and support less experienced attendees.
- Recovery points.
  - What happens if someone falls behind?
  - Consider building in breaks that can also be used to catch up.
  - How can you structure your content to provide ways to catch up. For example, a GitHub repo with branches for every stage of the workshop, so someone who gets stuck at stage 2 can skip ahead to the code for stage 3 and continue to follow.
- Learner participation
  - What questions can you ask the audience to keep them engaged with the content you are presenting?
  - How can you involve the participants in your exercises?
- Adapting to your participants.
  - What information can you gather from your participants to help inform your workshop?
  - If the participants already know a section of your content, or the content is too advanced, how do you deal with it?
- What happens after?
  - How do you enable your participants to continue learning?
  - Is there a worksheet or further exercise you can provide?
  - Is there a channel or forum they can continue to ask questions in?
