# Workshop development

### S1  ~00:00.528
> Specific needs.

### S2  ~00:04.684
> Awesome, thank you. Joe just reminded to start a recording so I am recording this session. And as the recording starts, this is about how to teach GitHub. I'm here and Cynthia was just introducing herself as well with a background in instructional design. So today kind of what we're hoping to cover. First, I really want to find out from you guys how you're planning on teaching GitHub. I obviously as a music teacher did not ever study computer science formally. I did all of my learning kind of on my own so I would really like to hear about what that looks like in your communities and you've already done the community assessment step. Then we'll talk a bit about how GitHub teaches GitHub. So what that looks like for our training on the more formal side. The teaching philosophy behind it, so kind of what we like to keep on the front of our mind when we're teaching when we're developing new curriculum kind of the guiding principles there. And also point you to some more resources so as you are teaching and helping people learn about Git and GitHub, some good things you probably already have seen. Joe and Hector are awesome so you probably already know all that stuff so it'll be quick. So this part, I would love to hear from you guys. You've been quiet so far so-- and which is cool if you want to stay quiet. But how are you guys teaching GitHub? What have you already taught or have you not taught? What's the context for all that? Any brave takers? I'll wait. It's cool.

### S3  ~01:43.039
> I'll go for it.

### S2 ~01:44.223
> Awesome. Thank you, Wilhelm.

### S3 ~01:44.648
> So this is teaching kind of specifically, right? Not anything other than technically.

### S2 ~01:50.821
> Whatever. It could be both.

### S3 ~01:53.537
> So I mean for GitHub specifically, I think it's mostly for me [hacker?] phones so people who maybe on the same team [word?] who also need to use GitHub because that's how we like to collaborate. Then I would kind of-- necessity teach them the basics. Oh, you stage, you commit, then you [inaudible] and kind of set up the repo and GitHub is I guess more kind of [southern?] country. But in terms of formally teaching a class, I haven't really done that but that's kind of in my experience.

### S2 ~02:20.771
> Very cool. I hadn't even thought about that. That makes a lot of sense. You find yourself suddenly forced to work with somebody and--

### S3 ~02:26.927
> Yeah.

### S2 ~02:27.642
> --they have no idea what you're doing. Nice. Do you see yourself teaching more formally in your education community or any place else, or is it really more of a one-on-one basis for now?

### S3 ~02:40.712
> I think a lot of people are kind of interested in it and we did a-- we did it for Oktoberfest in our community. We did for an open source workshop.

### S2 ~02:49.664
> Awesome.

### S3 ~02:51.405
> And people came in kind of expecting to learn about Git because they felt like they didn't know enough. So now we're thinking maybe we should do explicit Git/GitHub workshop. And Joe's in London so we might do that with him so--

### S2 ~03:03.818
> Perfect. That sounds awesome. Thank you. Thanks for speaking up about that. How about anybody else? Anything similar experiences or very different?

### S4 ~03:15.835
> Yes. I've tried to [inaudible] when I was out to some not paper but some work [inaudible] class related to [inaudible]. I tried to use Git and it [inaudible]. Sometimes I could only myself doing the Git part and all the guys like mainly the files but they see this [inaudible] this is cool. And I say, [inaudible] share a call. And also I can-- one time talk about [inaudible] inside of another, there was introducing stuff for the betterment organized for the various [inaudible].

### S2 ~04:14.378
> Very cool. So it sounds like it kind of comes up on the auxiliary to other topics a lot, but people don't necessarily dive into it headfirst.

### S4 ~04:24.653
> Yes. So the problem I see is that you just don't mention version control in class. So I try to, at least to my friends, to share this.

### S2 ~04:39.665
> That's awesome. Well, thank you. And good for you. Does anybody else have a similar experience that their teachers just don't talk about version control?  Really? What? Every person raised their hand?

### S3 ~04:53.041
> So yeah. Some of the things that [inaudible]. On that note, we didn't get to learn version control at university, so we kind of started this society like it's [inaudible]. And we had a GitHub workshop two or three weeks ago. So that went quite well. It was taught by a fellow student who also works in the industry. So he taught Git from scratch in one hour and a half, which is quite [inaudible].

### S2  ~05:23.581
> That's awesome. That sounds like a lot of fun. Lot of information in an hour and a half. Okay. Cool. Yes?

### S5  ~05:31.302
> It's slightly difficult because I tried running a workshop for it for a consult. And the first meeting that we had, and it's actually quite tough to get people to get into it because they don't really understand what it does. And so they're not really interested in it. And it's quite hard for me to teach them as well because I'm quite used to doing it the command line way, like Git Bash. But a lot of them are new to Bash to begin with, so it's been really, really tough trying to get them to work at the same pace because everyone comes at different skill levels. So I guess we could use the desktop version, like the app thing that runs on the desktop, but personally, I don't know how that works either, so [laughter].

### S2  ~06:24.212
> Yeah. No, and that's one of-- so far a couple common themes have come up, like it's so much information in a short amount of time and that everybody's at such a different level coming into it even if you can get them on board with the concept, which is something to jump over anyway. Then maybe they want the command line, maybe they want desktop, maybe they don't want anything local. Yeah. No. And we'll talk about kind of-- there's no answer. But we'll talk about some strategies for working with that. Does anybody else want to chime in? Are you guys ready to move on?

### S6  ~06:57.440
> Hello?

### S2  ~06:59.425
> Hi, Conrad.

### S6  ~07:01.027
> Hi. So for my community, before I started programming I couldn't find my way around GitHub so I didn't even know what to do with GitHub although I had seen it through so many social development blogs. But when I got into my university community and we heard about it, it was a lot of code which promotes contributions open source, I came to understand what GitHub was all about. So doing it was a lot of [inaudible]. We actually tried to teach people how to use GitHub beginning, how you clone repositories, local requests, branching, and writing commands on all the lines. So the main group through which we introduced people to GitHub in our communities actually telling them to join [inaudible] organizations since you always have mentors who better help you on how to get along using GitHub and the best [ties?] you can use. And we did my class, the computer science department actually created [inaudible] which was just because we [inaudible] so it's just a good way I try to introduce my classmates and members of my family to keep up on all ideas. We do projects we worked on in class and try to help so each group sits according to the project they have worked on in class and we push those projects to give up just to get a feel of how GitHub works.

### S2  ~08:27.522
> Awesome. That's a great place to start. I'm glad they're doing it in a-- your school's on board, and helping move that along, and helping people learn at the same time, get people excited about open source. And like you said, it's a good way to get many eyes on your code. That's awesome. Anybody else? I don't want to cut anybody off before we move on. All right. Cool. There'll be more chances to talk about stuff. So I'm going to share my screen again here. All right. Okay. First of all, thank you guys for sharing that. That was awesome. That helps me understand exactly where you're coming from and what you're hoping to get out of this and some of the challenges you're facing. Talking about how GitHub uses GitHub. There's a couple of different ways. The first is - let's see if I can share this again - our formal training that I was telling you guys about. This would not really make a lot of sense for what you guys are doing, so I won't spend too much time talking about it. This is our website. This is our services.GitHub.com. You can see the training and kind of the resources we have there.

### S2  ~09:42.442
> The biggest way that we're trying to outreach is through these webinars we do sometimes, which is the same content from our in-person training, and the on-demand curriculum, which I'm not sure if you guys have-- I'm sure Hector has probably already told you guys about this. I'll throw a link in chat if I could find the button, which I can't. I'll put it in the campus experts Slack channel. This I would recommend sharing with people who are interested in learning. It's not really set up for classroom use, but I think Joe has actually used it in the classroom a few times with some success. Basically, it's just a step-by-step way of working through GitHub. We have one for the desktop tool. I know, Sarah, you were mentioning this would be an opportunity to get people started. And it's just little bite-sized chunks of instructions of kind of how to get through. So this is still a work in progress. We're still working on this all of the time. It's really pretty new. Hopefully, this will be open source soon, so when you guys are teaching with this, you can have some suggestions. Pull requests are welcome.

### S2  ~10:48.749
> So we do have a chat room that goes along with this. Traffic is still pretty slow because it's still pretty new, but there's been a lot of interest in even this desktop class. Now that this is launched, we had a significant drop of people in our webinars. So I think there's an interest for people to be able to learn at their own pace, which I'm sure is something you guys can relate to. When you're at school, everybody's busy. Everybody has a lot of stuff going on, and being able to fit it into their own schedule is important. Train the trainer. Sometimes big companies want their own in-house trainer, so we'll teach them how to do that. How did you guys-- I'm curious. So I know some of you already mentioned how you started to learn about Git and GitHub. I know I learned it-- I was learning front-end web development, and it just was something-- it was a necessity, right? It was just something I read about in a tutorial once, and so as I was building websites, I ended up using it and didn't really understand how important it was until I royally screwed something up and needed to go back in time after I've totally broken something. But I think everybody finds their way to Git and GitHub in a different way and I'm curious if anybody-- we don't have to take too much time on this unless somebody really wants to talk about it, but does anybody want to share how you guys found out about Git and GitHub? It sounds like your communities aren't super aware of it.

### S5  ~12:09.088
> For a hackathon and had to use Git. Totally destroyed the repository a couple of times [laughter]. Had my teammates pulling their hair out because I didn't [much commit?] very well [laughter].

### S2  ~12:25.670
> That's funny. It sounds like maybe you might've been on a team with Wilhelm [laughter] at some point. Hackathons are a common place to talk about Git. That's awesome.

### S3  ~12:33.897
> Yeah. Same thing [laughter].

### S2  ~12:36.249
> Oh, really? You learned about it--?

### S3  ~12:38.269
> Yeah. Yeah. I don't think we've been to a hackathon together, Sarah. Maybe soon [laughter]. But I mean, it's I think where other people learn about this in their community.

### S2  ~12:49.451
> That's really interesting. I'd never heard that before--

### S3  ~12:51.367
> Actually, just thinking about this now-- the way I discovered it is there's this tool. So I used it in a [CodeSpell?] project in school. And I didn't collaborate on it with anybody else so it wasn't really actually that particularly useful, I think. It was just me working on it. I didn't really need version control. But there's this tool called Gource which does animation of Git projects over time that are really cool and shows how people contribute. And I wanted to use that. And because I needed to-- and because I needed a Git repository as an input, I started using Git. So no collaborative reason at all. I just wanted to have a nice visualization.

### S2  ~13:33.631
> That's really funny. What was the name of that? How do you spell that tool name?

### S3  ~13:37.114
> G-O-U-R-C-E.

### S2  ~13:43.000
> Okay. I'm going to have to look that up later. That one's new to me. So that was so inspiring that you're like, "I want to make pretty pictures about my repositories. I have to learn Git"?

### S3  ~13:50.524
> Yeah. Yeah.

### S2  ~13:51.569
> That's awesome. That's funny. Anybody else? Any interesting ways you found, stumbled upon Git, or how you specifically learned the steps of Git? I know when I first started learning Git, I was-- one of the most confusing things-- and it's not that confusing. I don't know why it was hard. You know when you create a repository you can use Git and Nit, and create one from scratch. You can also have an existing reposit, like a project, turn it into a repository locally, and then upload it to GitHub. Or you can start something on GitHub and then clone it. Like that to me-- there were so many sets of instructions, and I couldn't figure out which was better. I would do both. I would clone it and then do Git in it because I didn't-- I was just trying to follow the instructions and they weren't very clear. And I think that kind of thing probably happens a lot. Git is awesome and it can do so many things. But sometimes there's too many choices of how to learn and how to start out. And that make's it really, really difficult sometimes.

### S2  ~14:54.104
> So we're going to talk about some - let me check my screen again - specific strategies of how we can make that easier for people. How we can tune that down so it's not just a million ways to do one simple thing. Okay. Let's see. And that kind of comes into this whole The Teaching Philosophy, and how we choose how to teach. And that's a learners first thing. So we try and figure out exactly where the person is and then meet them there. Not always easy if you're teaching to a big group of people because everybody might be some place different. One person might be totally comfortable on the command line. One person might have absolutely no comfort level there, and yada yada. But as much as possible, meeting people where they are is really important.

### S2  ~15:45.743
> We like to use the GitHub Flow as that kind of common starting ground. And we'll get into a little bit more details about that. But finding just one thing to focus on that everybody can grasp is enormous. Obviously, the pace matters and the order that you talk about things matter. Git being such a complex software and such a-- it's really, I don't know. It doesn't feel very tangible at first. It's really just difficult to grasp the base concepts of it. If you go into a conversation about Git and start talking about some of those higher level concepts like different types of branching strategies, you could talk about a rebase to somebody who has no idea what a commit is or what a branch is, or what version control is. They're going to be so lost from the very start, and they're going to be trying to relate everything back to rebase, event though that's not really a good mental model of how Git works. So the way that people are introduced to these concepts really can make a big difference to how long it takes them to understand it and grasp it.

### S2  ~16:48.384
> Focusing on the flow, so the GitHub Flow will talk about, like I said, that workflow where you create a branch, you make commits, pull request, collaborate, merge. Everybody at any level can learn from that. That's something that no matter how good you are at Git, keeping that simple workflow, that's just the best practice. It's also something that's not so esoteric. If people are not used to the command line, they can kind of figure out that general shape of what that workflow's going to look like. So that's a really important point to focus on that. And we've already talked about when you guys have been teaching Git or GitHub. Sounds like a lot of one on one. Sounds like there's maybe some opportunities to do some larger group things, which is exciting, some workshops. So when we get to the resources kind of near the tail end of this, hopefully, we can give you guys some good ideas on where to start if you're interested in hosting a meetup or some kind of workshop.

### S2  ~17:48.013
> By the way, just feel free to interrupt me at any point. I didn't say that at the beginning, but I don't know if Hector and Joe have told you this. We do zoom meetings like this all the time at GitHub. Once a day we'll have a meetup with 10, 20 people on a zoom call, and it's really weird for me to be talking for this long on any zoom call so please feel free to interrupt with any questions or comments at any point, just friendly PSA.

### S2  ~18:17.794
> Okay, so GitHub Flow, I posted an emoji there but it's not showing up, which is sad. So can I see just a show of hands who's really comfortable or familiar with the GitHub Flow? All right. I have to flip through some [inaudible]. Okay. So the GitHub Flow, well, good. Hopefully, we'll all learn more about the GitHub Flow now. Is basically just a set of instructions along the way that you'd use when you're collaborating with Git and GitHub. They're the best practice to how to get stuff done. If you're already used to working with Git, this seems like a no-brainer, but introducing this right at the start of teaching someone Git can really help them grasp all those other, kind of complex pieces. So let me show-- don't need to see more. Guides.GitHub.com. I'll post this in the Slack chat also.

### S2  ~19:12.988
> I use this visual, so does everybody on training team, all the time when we discuss the GitHub Flow because it's interactive. You can go through and as you click, it'll kind of give a description. So GitHub Flow starts off with this create a branch thing, which you guys know. When you're describing branches, most likely since you're going to be working in a community that doesn't know about version control, it won't be that difficult. People sometimes if they're used to other version control systems like Subversion or some older centralized models, branches were super heavy, and it was an actual whole copy of the project. So people avoided branching. It was nerve-wracking, stuff broke all the time. But with Git, a branch is just a 40 character SHA-1 hash. So getting people to buy into the concept of branching early and branching often. That can be the first thing out of your mouth. That's super important and something you should come back to a lot.

### S2  ~20:12.925
> So they create a branch. It's a safe place, as you guys know, where you can make your changes. You don't have to worry about breaking anything in the production code. It's this master branch here. Talking about commits can be a rabbit hole. You guys probably know as you get into the more advanced commands like redoing history, the details of a commit structure are really important. The parent-child relationship, the trees, and blobs. When you're teaching to beginners, one of the most important things is just to frame commits not as a change, not like you save a Word document and you notice a change, but it's a set, it's a snapshot of the repository at that point in time. Any commit is a snapshot of the whole repository at that point in time. Just repeat that in your head 100 times, talking about commits.

### S2  ~21:01.947
> Just like we encourage people to branch early, we want them to open a pull request early. This is a great time to talk about just collaboration, which you guys seem to be introducing it, and when you're already working with collaboration, so it makes a lot of sense to you guys and the people that you're teaching. Pull requests are where you compare two branches, which you guys already know. I hope it doesn't feel like I'm talking down to you guys and trying to teach you stuff you already know. If anything, I'm just trying to use the language that I would use when I'm teaching beginners. Pull requests can be confusing because they look a lot like issues, but they really are a comparison of two branches. So even when, later on, you continue to collaborate and make more commits, you are still just comparing those branches. So the pull request will update.

### S2  ~21:51.232
> The squirrel is for deploy. I don't know why they picked the squirrel other than it's cute. But the concept here is you can run your Travis CI, you can do testing, you can actually deploy from your branch, and that's cool. Finally, when you merge, all of your commits are then included back onto the master branch. So you have a safe place to work on changes and actually get feedback for those changes without ever touching anything on master.

### S3  ~22:19.723
> Can I ask something real quick?

### S2  ~22:20.298
> Of course.

### S3  ~22:21.308
> When you were mentioning kind of pull requests and adding commits to it afterwards, I was reminded of a situation where basically a few people on a project I was working with, they thought that if you make a pull request, then it needs to be final. And if there's something wrong with it then the pull request gets closed and the new one needs to be created after someone individually updates the branch. Whereas obviously, you can start a pull request, and then you can close it and reopen it. So I think the point I'm trying to make is I think a lot of people, they know how to do many things, but they don't know if what they are doing is necessarily the right thing. So they're scared to do it one way because they're not sure that's the accepted way. So how do you kind of help say what the correct way is? Because in my experience, that comes mostly from people using it themselves or seeing how other people use it, and it's a difficult thing to just [inaudible] teach.

### S2  ~23:23.307
> Right. No, that's a really great point. Thank you for bringing that up. So I think that problem people aren't sure exactly how to handle something or they're not sure what to do can come up in a lot of different places along the workflow or along their development process. Specifically for pull requests, that's something I think of any of things that people can get wrong [laughter], is a little bit easier. I think as long as people-- as soon as they can realize that it's just a comparison between branches and that any further updates to that branch will be reflected in the pull request, and even just showing them that. In our training, I'm not sure. I'd have to think harder about if our on-demand training link that I shared includes anything like that specifically, but if you can get someone's hands on a keyboard, you get them to create a pull request, and then say, "Oh hey, let's add something else locally and then push it up and look at the pull request." Sometimes it doesn't click until you do it yourself. But with all the other things, I mean, Git is hard. And it's not meant to be hard. It's very forgiving but it's very hard and there's 8,000 ways to skin an Octocat. Something somebody said in class once that totally cracked me up [laughter]. And it's intimidating. So part of it is just being as clear as possible, but I think even bigger than that, it's just setting up a culture where it's okay to make mistakes and Git is forgiving. They would have to try so hard to really break anything and everybody's learning all the time. So making mistakes publicly and praising them and moving on is hard, but valued. Yeah. That was a good question.

### S2  ~25:06.893
> Anything else? Do you guys have any more questions about just the general GitHub Flow conversation? Cool. Let's move on. So the GitHub Flow is important. Super important. Just skipping the deploy step, it's these five steps, and as I said earlier, I think this is the binding glue between all levels of people getting used to Git. Any beginner can understand wanting to make changes in a safe environment without actually messing up their master code, right? But any really advanced user might-- like you were saying earlier, they might mess up the pull request stage. They might do it in kind of a different order. They might not understand that it's just a comparison. You continue to work on it. So this is something I like to really focus on throughout all stages of the teaching, whether you're working on the command line and going through more advanced commits or other commands or you're really starting from scratch and just walking them through what a repository looks like on GitHub.com. I think this is a really good place to start.

### S2  ~26:21.919
> How we are on time? By the way, I've never done this before so I have no idea how long is going to take. So hopefully, we're somewhere around about where we ought to be. In terms of other topics, like the order, and Cynthia, please feel free to jump in and correct me at any point here or add to this, I was trying to think how we try to order the topics we talk about so that we don't overwhelm somebody new and that we put it in a logical order. Because I think with Git that's really important. Obviously, I think it's important that somebody understands what version control is and what it does, and the role that GitHub plays. That can be a complex conversation, but I don't think it has to be. GitHub is where you interact with these repositories. You also have a local copy, that kind of thing.

### S2  ~27:07.933
> Generally, I'm guessing since you're working with younger people that are in college, the interface of GitHub.com will be hopefully pretty easy for them to navigate. But I still think walking through just saying, "Oh, this is the code tab. This is where all of the documents live. You see these words like branch and commits and those are okay." Just acknowledging all the different things because there's a lot of complexities there. And then go into the issues tab, just talking about really quickly what that is. A walkthrough of what a repository looks like doesn't have to take more than 10 minutes, but I think can give people a huge level of familiarity with vocabulary, for one, and they can see how what they're actually going to be looking at and clicking on interacts with that workflow that is so important. Then--

### S6  ~27:57.532
> I'd like to ask a question.

### S2  ~28:01.539
> Hm?

### S6  ~28:03.942
> Hello.

### S2  ~28:05.056
> Hi. Yeah. I can hear you.

### S6  ~28:06.763
> Yeah. So I have a question. For example, what you said in the beginning where you had [inaudible] where you have to create repositories on GitHub and [inaudible] all creating them locally and [inaudible] repository. So I have the same issue because when I started coding with [inaudible] I tried to use the book [inaudible]. And so it talked mostly about [inaudible]. So at some point in time, I got confused with the [inaudible] between Git and GitHub. And that was what caused most of the confusion on how to start a repository. So I'd like to know how [inaudible] to let beginners, how [inaudible] tell beginners about the relationship between Git and Github and how would you actually tell them what are the ways to introduce the relationship between Git and GitHub.

### S2  ~29:00.065
> That is a great question. First of all, I'm glad that I'm not the only person who's had trouble with Git, and Nit, and Git Clone, because to this day, nobody else has ever told me they struggle with that. So thank you for that [laughter]. My opinion on this, this is just my opinion, so Cynthia or any of you guys might have something different to say on this. I think it really depends on the person you're teaching or the people you're teaching. If they're like you and they've already been working with Pro Git which is-- I mean, it's the best place to learn Git but it's also-- I wouldn't call it beginner-friendly. It's like they're giving you all the information at once. I think it would be really important to tell that person where the difference is. This is Git. This is GitHub, so they can sort the new information in their mind as they get it.

### S2  ~29:44.884
> If it's a true very beginner who has had no experience with Git, I don't think it's as important right up front. But it's all case-by-case. If people are confused with that kind of thing about, okay, how do I Git Clone. Anything where they're not sure if they're interacting with the remote repository on GitHub.com or their local repository, I think is a good time to start that conversation. Usually, what I say about it is, I mean, anything that you would go through on that repository walkthrough, where you see, okay, the code tab, we see issues and pull requests, the pulls, wiki, that's all GitHub. GitHub is built on top of Git to help you interact with your repositories. Git is just the commit structure, right, and the pointers, the refs. Anything you can do with Git Add, Git Commit, Git Branch, you can merge. One of the fuzziest areas is pull requests. You can merge, and it's only Git. But once you have a pull request, once you have that conversation around it, that's when it becomes GitHub. There are some things that are both, like tags. There are tags that are just Git, and there's a little bit more of a complex way to do tags with GitHub that are a little bit gray area. Does that answer your question?

### S6  ~31:05.578
> It does.

### S2  ~31:06.727
> Awesome. Thank you.

### S4  ~31:11.133
> Sorry, may I add?

### S2  ~31:13.363
> Yes.

### S4  ~31:14.480
> The problem I saw, if you could talk about it, is that people sometimes do not understand that there's a difference between [inaudible] and the remote. Maybe you're not teaching what GitHub is, but telling them there is a remote repository when they actually need that. After that, may [inaudible], but specifically on Meetup, and not on any remote Git. I think that helps.

### S2  ~31:52.610
> Yeah. And honestly, the way we do it in class Is, we do not even bring up the difference between Git and GitHub in any big amount of detail. And we go through the workflow entirely on GitHub.com. We just do everything on one repository. We don't even talk about remotes and local copies until we get all the way through the concept of creating a branch on GitHub.com, committing on GitHub.com, all of that, just there. Then when we clone, they clone the same repository locally, and we go through the same steps locally. Depending on the group, sometimes they don't need the full walkthrough on GitHub.com, but for beginners, I think it's really helpful. Because especially with Git, you have a copy of the code on master. You create a branch of another, what feels like a copy of the code, and then you clone, and you clone both of those branches. Suddenly, there's so many copies of your code and interacting within, feels really complicated. Push and merge, people confuse those words all the time because it's branch communication.

### S2  ~32:56.921
> I don't know. So that's a really good point. Thank you for bringing that up, that if you can focus on GitHub.com first and get them bought in there, then moving on towards, "When you work locally, this is how you do it." I think that's a good way to look at it. You guys walked us right into the common questions. Those are the main things that come up. There's just so many copies of your code everywhere. Talking about the staging area, Git Add, why you need that, comes up a lot. We like to do a Git Add-p - I'll put that in Slack too - example to show, when you do Git Add-p, you can actually stage little parts of the file, instead of just the whole file at a time. That helps people wrap their heads around why we need a staging area. "Oh, it's because we want our commits to be logical units of change, and this helps us not slow down our coding, just to work around Git."

### S2  ~33:59.982
> Once people master that and they feel really good about the work flow, they can do it on their remote, they can do it locally, that's when people start to have the more complex questions like, "What if we're both working on the same file? What if we're working on the same line?" Merge conflicts. We go through merge conflicts, and then we go into rewriting history. Just for context, this that I've kind of outlined here would be covered over a two-day, in-person class. This would be a lot. This isn't going to get covered in an hour or an hour-and-a-half. If you do ever teach about rewriting history, any rewriting history, like reset, hard, rebase, commit amend, anything that's going to cherry pick that will change a commit ID, it's really important to talk about commit structure. And you probably saw in Pro Git when you were reading it that there's some really great illustrations about what exactly is a commit, and the parent-child structure to that? Main reason being why it's so important is, if you break a commit ID, if you change it, and it's a parent it's been pushed up to the remote, any children after that, any other commits that have been made or that might be being made on your colleague's remote copies, are going to break. Other advanced topics that sometimes come up would follow then, said modules, filter branch, but my guess is, those would be, not a good idea to do at any hackathon, and would probably be way overkill for newbies. I feel like that was a lot of information. That was an information dump. Questions or comments about that? Does it make sense? Is it similar to how you guys learned GitHub, or is it different? Just processing? Cool. I respect that. Okay.

### S4  ~36:11.091
> I don't like step-by-step, but all at the same time, but as I need it, and also failing. That was not the best way of learning.

### S2  ~36:27.775
> I think failing is common in everybody's learning Git, though. Git is hard. Everybody struggles with it at some point. I've never met anybody that was like, "Yeah, I just got it right the first time. It makes total sense. I never struggled at all." And I think being as open to the fact that it's hard, and people are going to make mistakes, makes it easier for people to jump in and try. I mean, if they don't make mistakes, they're not going to be learning anything. They wouldn't be doing anything. Even if they follow a tutorial perfectly, step-by-step for Git, they wouldn't be understanding the steps, and the why. And that's when it gets more fun, anyway.

### S4  ~37:08.047
> That's also why I want to teach people how to use it, so they don't have to go through what I did.

### S2  ~37:17.069
> So I'm curious, how did you -- What resources did you find, that you felt like you failed, using them?

### S4  ~37:25.848
> I learned the basic and start using, but I didn't know what anything was, and I was blind, blindly doing things. That's what I mean. That's why I want to teach people, so they will fail. They will break things, but having somebody that at least gave you resources is way of learning [inaudible].

### S2  ~37:59.406
> Awesome. I can already tell, it sounds like you've been that person for a lot of people. Good for you. Good for all of you guys. That's exciting stuff. Some other resources that I want to share with you guys, and you might already have these, so on-demand I already shared. Depending on your group, your community, it might be a good thing just to kind of put out there and say, "Hey, if you're curious just go through this." It 's not a complete Git education by any means but it will get their feet wet in that workflow. Webinars, we do still have webinars the GitHub for developers and sometimes Git essentials, so whether you guys are curious or if there's people in your community that are curious, they're free. They take quite a bit of time but we also have recordings of them to send out.

### S2  ~38:47.790
> Have you guys seen this education lesson plans? They're cool. I'll put a link, also if you guys have the slides, I'll [inaudible] put this on the chat anyhow. So these are shared lesson plans that we've developed, that the training team has developed for these classes I've been telling you about that we deliver to enterprise businesses. This is the same content. It's geared a little bit more toward a formal classroom setting, so it's been kind of reformatted and tweaked a bit but intro to GitHub, just basic, for everyone is the desktop. So yeah, check those out if you're interested in doing more of a group learning thing. Those are meant to be resources for how to actually go in the order of how to teach it, and let me see if I can clip these-- the order of how to teach it, along with how long they should take, that kind of thing. Get SCM, so this is where you find Pro Git like you were talking about. So has anybody read Pro Git or is reading Pro Git? Yeah, I don't blame you. I haven't read it front to back either. That would be a lot of time. What was that?

### S4  ~40:09.132
> I will read it.

### S2  ~40:15.733
> So Pro Git is-- I like to read it kind of section by section personally because it's outlaid really well so you can see kind of the sections, I also am not-- I hate to admit it, I don't love reading. I don't love just sitting down with a book. That's not my thing but Pro Git is really spelled out in a way where you can pick the parts you need. And this is the source for documentation for Git. This is the place to go. I do want to find the commit. I wonder if it's this one. So they have a lot of examples. They go all the way through. I'm not sure exactly the page with the commit structure drawings but they are--

### S1  ~41:04.521
> Branching, it's--

### S2  ~41:03.806
> It's under--?

### S1  ~41:05.060
> Under branching. Yeah just go there and then--

### S2  ~41:09.100
> Thank you, Cynthia.

### S1  ~41:10.284
> There you go.

### S2  ~41:11.190
> Cynthia's the master. She's the best. Yeah, so these visuals for what a commit structure looks like, the commit, the tree that makes up the commit, plus the metadata along with this parent-child structure and how the commit ID matters from parent to child. This is a great resource but as you were saying, not super duper beginner-friendly. If you're just going to try to learn Git, to sit down with this book for the first time-- unless you're a pro at reading documentation, which you may be-- could be a little heavy. Even more than that, there are reference pages which again [inaudible] probably already know about. Their reference pages are the best, so if you're just really curious, what is Git push, what is this-- the description, all of the possible options and flags that you can do for every command, they're laid out really clearly here in a way that's easy to reference for other people and to share.

### S2  ~42:09.754
> Some other just Git cheat sheets. I'll put this in  chat too. This is a PDF, feel free to print this out. It's a two-page PDF, we put it on cardstock usually, with just some of the most basic commands that if you're just getting used to Git, and you don't have it in your muscle memory yet, to have this by you where you can actually see these most common things is really helpful. And this other one, I could only find the image of it, but I really like that they put the commands kind of in order of that workflow that we were talking about. Since that workflow is the easiest way to wrap your head around it, to begin with, and sometimes the transition from the workflow to the command line can be another one of the really big challenges to get over, I like being able to visualize those commands as they kind of happen and where they fit into the puzzle piece. So take them for what they are. They're not perfect. They are what they are. Any other ideas for-- what resources have you guys found really helpful? Because I would like to beg, borrow, and steal those and share them with other people.

### S7  ~43:26.056
> In terms of online resources, I've taken a look at Udacity and [inaudible]. A lot of their teaching [photos?] are [inaudible].

### S2  ~43:35.587
> Awesome, what did you think?

### S7  ~43:37.537
> I found they were pretty good because it's a [inaudible] and they go through it step by step, and you can learn at your own pace as well, so it's something I really liked.

### S2  ~43:52.499
> Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. We're in such a weird position as trainers, where we are developing our own content, but it's so non-competitive. It's always so exciting to hear there's other good content out there that people are liking. I think I did-- I'm in the middle of the Udacity one, and that's the one with the videos like you were saying, that go and really explain it as you go. They're really nice. Anybody else? When someone's like, "I want to learn about Git," what link do you send them? Well, now you'll have a bunch of options to send them because I just sent you a bunch in Slack. I heard somebody go unmuted. In terms of content, that's all I've got. Cynthia, do you have anything that you want to add, or share, or mention?

### S1  ~44:55.576
> No, I think you did a great job, thank you.

### S2  ~44:58.432
> Cool. Do you guys have any other questions? Or things you guys want to talk about?

### S7  ~45:03.831
> I think the biggest challenge for my [inaudible] to teach Git and Github is I'm still not too confident in my skills yet because I didn't really get [inaudible] for that long a period of time, so to be able to stand in front of everybody else, and making sure that what I'm teaching is the right material and the best practices is [inaudible] right now. So I think that's the biggest barrier for me right now is to be more comfortable with my own skill before teaching other people.

### S2  ~45:32.290
> Yeah, and that's hard. I think you should definitely look into those open-source lesson plans because those are a really step-by-step thing and there's a lot of language of how to describe things to help you out, so you feel confident about what you're saying. On the other hand though, I don't know if that ever gets 100% fully better, because even Cynthia can tell you, a few weeks ago I was in teaching a class and this guy comes in and he sits in the front row with Pro Git, that book that I haven't read, and I work at GitHub, and he smacks it down on the desk, and I'm like, "Oh, no. This guy's going to know more than me." And it's like every class I teach, there's always-- probably everybody knows more than I do about something, and usually it's Git. They have a really great question. They know something I don't know. And even having the language in my own mouth to say, "Oh, I don't know the answer to that, but I'll it up and get back to you." Or, "Oh, that's really interesting. I didn't know that, but I'm glad to learn it." That's really freeing to be comfortable saying that in front of a group of people. Not easy, but freeing. And I think with Git, it's like I'm never going to know everything about Git. So don't let that ever hold you back because nobody's going to know everything about Git And if you try to pretend you do, you're going to lose credibility because people know that you can't.

### S1  ~46:49.117
> That was a very [inaudible].

### S2  ~46:52.321
> Hi, Hector. Absolutely.

### S8  ~46:54.585
> Sorry. I've been packing and everything so my house is a mess.

### S2  ~46:57.460
> It looks beautiful.

### S8  ~46:59.445
> Thank you. I also wanted to extend the offer-- I think that was Gary that was on the [inaudible]. Extend that offer if at any time you just want a friendly audience to kind of teach to, I'm volunteering myself. I'm also sure that a lot of the other experts would volunteer. So if you want to have a little class that we bring a course, you could reuse if you wanted to. I'm all ears. So if you'd like to.

### S2  ~47:32.451
> That's awesome. Thank you, Hector.

### S7  ~47:34.018
> Thanks a lot, Hector.

### S2  ~47:36.865
> I'm seeing some other good resources that are posted in chat. Git for Humans, Git for Humans is awesome. Thank you, Hector. Code words, oh, I'll have to look at that one. An article about how Git internals works and then try.githelp.io is awesome. And there's a really cool-- that reminds of the branching one, which I'll find. I'll post in the chat afterward so I don't take up time just Googling it. But there's a really nice visualization tool for how to-- where you can see the commits being made and all that stuff. It's really nice.

### S4  ~48:08.304
> I saw Git it. This, I will find the link. But it's a lab-based, I think [inaudible]. It's all through learning Git. It's really nice. It appears to be a visual, but now it's [inaudible].

### S2  ~48:33.559
> Very cool.

### S1  ~48:34.272
> And that was actually created by one of the girls that worked at GitHub. And yes, it is open source project, very cool.

### S4  ~48:46.778
> And it's also translated in many languages. So that's even better.

### S2  ~48:54.999
> Yes, it is. That's always great. Yeah. And our cheat sheet, that first blue cheat sheet I shared with you guys. Oh, I'm still sharing. I shouldn't be doing that. Is also in a ton of languages. It's nice. Is there anything else you guys want to talk about or questions you have before we wrap up? I'm sure-- oh, go ahead.

### S8  ~49:22.132
> No, I was just going to say while they're thinking I know a couple of the things that came up. And I'll let all of you ask if you have more questions about it. And I know we had some questions about how to cater to people at different experience levels. So maybe we can talk about how we do that in class as well as questions what seem to be workshop management type things, which is kind of along with those different experience levels. What are some ways that we could break up the class to make easier people to follow along?

### S2  ~49:55.329
> Yeah. Do you want to talk about that, Hector? I think that's awesome. No [laughter].

### S1  ~49:59.351
> I can take a running leap at it.

### S2  ~50:03.391
> Yes. Please do.

### S1  ~50:04.262
> If you guys want. So I think the thing to remember with Git and GitHub that's really tricky or that I've found over the last couple of years is that a lot of folks come to Github with a ton of Git knowledge and really struggle with UI. And the same is true in the opposite direction. So you'll have a lot of people who can really handle the UI well, but struggle with the command line. And so I think that one of the things that we found that we have to be really careful is not to make an assumption that because someone knows pieces of Git that they understand all of Git. Because the other thing that we hear a lot as folks will come to us and they will say, "Oh, I've been using Git for two years." And then after class, they come back and say I have no idea why I was doing what I was doing. And you've really helped me understand the reason behind the Git Add. People hate the fact they have stage, right. So they want to know why do I have to do Git Add. So filling in a lot of those gaps for folks who have more experience keeps them engaged in the class while you're still continuing to work with the folks who are struggling with the basics. So that's one of the things that I try to do is when I see I have a broadly mixed class is just still teach the fundamentals, still teach those basic steps, but add in the pieces that will be interesting for the folks who may not understand or have the depth.

### S2  ~51:28.995
> Perfect. Thank you, Cynthia and Hector. All right. We're wrapping up about five minutes before the hour here is over. So thank you guys for doing this and letting me come talk at you for 55 minutes. Hopefully, you got something out of it. If nothing else, you got a whole bunch of links to stuff. Obviously, I think you guys are going to be in touch with Hector a whole lot. I'm in the Slack room for campus experts. So if you think of any questions later, please don't hesitate to either ping me there or email me at brianamarie@github.com, which I just put in the chat also. If you think of anything later and you don't want to ask it in a public chat room or whatever, let me know or let Hector know. He's the trainer. Or Cynthia. And we'd love to talk more about it. Thank you guys. Have a good rest of your week.
