# Write a README

The README is the first thing people see when visiting your project. In this exercise, you'll apply what you learnt in this module to creating a README. 

## Task
You should complete **one** of the following:

- Describe how you would improve upon an existing project's README. It can be any project! Create a "module-5.md" file and describe the improvements in this file. 
- Create a new README. This can be for one of your own projects, a fictional project, or a project you know of that doesn't yet have a README. When you've created the README, create a "module-5.md" file and link to it in this file.

Once you've reviewed or completed a README, you'll receive feedback on your issue. **Remember** to take the time to read and comment on eachothers issues!

## Bonus activity
If you've improved upon another README, or create a README for a project without one, you could open a pull request to contribute that README to the project! Just make sure to read their contributing guidelines (usually found in CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow any pull request templates.
