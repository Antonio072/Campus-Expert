The [GitHub Professional Services](https://services.github.com/training/) team provides training on all levels of Git and GitHub usage, including GitHub Desktop and Pages. They recently launched a new training curriculum for [GraphQL](https://services.github.com/on-demand/graphql/). Their [on-demand GitHub training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/) is free and online to complete at your own pace.

Jenn is a product writer on the documentation team at GitHub. Documentation at GitHub serves many purposes, with documentation for users of the [product](https://help.github.com), documentation for developers using the [API and platform](https://developers.github.com) and [guides covering foundational concepts](https://guides.github.com). In this module, Jenn talks more about how GitHub writes and develops docs.

## Introduction üëã

During this module, you will watch a talk by Jenn Leaver, a writer on the GitHub docs team, and Matt Desmond, a trainer on the Professional Services team. During this talk, Jenn speaks about how GitHub approaches technical writing and documentation, and Matt helps you put that into practice, through setting up a GitHub Pages blog and then going through the process of open sourcing documentation. As part of this talk, Matt and Jenn fielded questions on technical writing from the Fall 2016 cohort of Campus Experts, and it may be helpful to have that Q&A document open as you watch the video. You can find it [here](https://github.com/campus-experts/fall-2016/blob/master/docs/technical-writing-answers.md).

Technical writing is a title that covers many things: it could be blogging, documentation or structured tutorials and workshops. Being able to write technical documents is an enormously important skill to develop for an industry in tech. Technical blogging helps build your profile as a professional and share knowledge with your peers. Writing good documentation is a vital skill every programmer must learn in order to write good software and collaborate with others. Technical writing skills will help you develop reusable content for talks and workshops.

As a student community, technical writing is important to ensuring accessible and long lasting knowledge sharing. Yourself or another member of your community could give an amazing and enlightening workshop on a novel technology to your peers; what happens when you've graduated? Can your successors in the community deliver that workshop? Or is your unique knowledge lost forever? Equally, as we discuss in the community management module, talks and workshops in physical spaces aren't accessible to everyone. Having written content to complement other forms of media helps ensure that everyone can participate in your community.

You can read about how GitHub approaches documentation in the [resources](resources/) directory.

## Exercise üìù

The exercise for this module is to write or improve a README. This can be a README for a project you run, or improving one for a project you know of or use. As a stretch goal, if you've improved another project's README, you could contribute it back to the project!
