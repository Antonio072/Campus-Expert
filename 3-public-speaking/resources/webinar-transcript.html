Let's do some screen sharing. Yes. And there we go. Zoom is really funny in many ways. This is, obviously, not the first time I'm using Zoom for one of these things, but every time I use it, I'm mystified as to where to put all your faces while I still have the screen sharing for myself available. Okay. Cool. So yeah. So I'm here to talk about demystifying public speaking. I'm especially excited to talk to this crew because I get to talk to a lot of engineers, designers, and other people where, often, companies are encouraging them to get out and speak often for recruiting purposes. So it's a special time for me to be able to talk to you all, who, I'm assuming, are hoping to speak for many different other reasons, other than just trying to get more people to come work with you on a thing. So I've cherry-picked content for this presentation about the process of writing and practicing and getting feedback on a prepared talk, but there is a ton more information in the book. If you could save all your questions till the end, I'll talk for like 20, 25 minutes and then I'm eager to chat with you about any questions you may have about public speaking.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>01:10.287</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So before we get to that, I wanted to share with you a picture of me giving my first-ever big talk. It was to a crew of more than 400 people at a conference in DC, and everything that could have possibly gone wrong just absolutely went wrong. A few days before the conference, I took a look at the conference website and realized that they'd invited me to speak about performance but they had strangely booked me a keynote slot, and a keynote slot is super-different than an opportunity to go talk about a very technical subject, like performance, so I kind of had to very quickly revamp what it was that I wanted to talk about in a very short amount of time. And then when I was standing next to the stage getting ready to go on, I was listening to them introduce me. Joe gave me a very nice introduction. Thank you. That was exactly about who I actually am. But while I was standing there at the conference, the folks introducing me definitely had invited the wrong person to come speak, meaning they thought that I was someone else. So this whole time as I'm watching them introduce whoever it was that they thought that they were going to-- that they actually invited to come and speak about performance, it was a nightmare. I realized like, "Oh no. I'm literally an impostor here." Look at my face. I was in so much pain during this whole experience. They forgot to turn down the lights. You could barely see my slides behind me. No one could read them. During Q&A, someone asked a question that I thought was a joke about gifs, but they weren't joking and I laughed at them anyway. It was like a tremendous nightmare or horror story. But that wasn't the end, right? I kept going. I made it through that talk, and I went on to keep on improving it and try to get better at public speaking. So at this point, I've had the privilege of giving lots of talks now, and I've learned a lot about what it feels like to get up in a spotlight and to try to say some prepared words to some people.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>02:58.697</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">But public speaking, as we all know, isn't just about conference talks, right? It's about any moment when you have that spotlight on you and you have to say some words to someone. So these skills that I'm utilizing to not fall on my face - I'm standing in my kitchen right now while I'm talking to you - they're really valuable when I'm leading a meeting at work, or when my boss asks me to talk about what projects are on my team's plate, or when I'm pitching a technical implementation in an architecture review. So there are lots of different places in our daily lives when we have this spotlight on us and we have to think about some words that we want to say and, hopefully, make it through that moment without puking or being reduced to a fit of nervous giggles. You do these things already, right? They're a big part of our work, of our studies, of everything. I want you take a moment and think about what circumstances you already have in your daily work life, and school life, when there's a spotlight on you, you need to say something coherent. But most of us get nervous when we're in that spotlight. I'm going to guess that the majority of people on this call get a little bit anxious when we think about public speaking, right? That includes me. There's this famous study that found that public speaking is our number one fear, more than heights, or spiders, or death. So when I was doing research on this book topic, I put a survey on Twitter and I asked folks, "What in particular makes them fear public speaking?" The spectrum of responses was huge. So my particular public speaking fear is tripping and falling when that spotlight's on me, which is why doing remote calls like this really help me reduce that fear. But now I know that my fear is not what everybody fears about public speaking.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>04:29.957</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So I'm going to read out some of the fears that people shared, and I want to see if any of this resonates with you. So there was a group of fears that had to do with voice or appearance of the speaker. So people said, "I'm afraid of hearing the sound or pitch of my own voice. I'm afraid of my heart racing, and therefore getting out of breath quicker or getting tongue-tied. I'm afraid of people judging whether I'm dressed appropriately. I'm afraid of being judged for being fat, not on what I'm saying. I'm afraid of needing to pee while I'm talking." A lot of people had fears about being wrong. So someone said, "I'm afraid of elegantly explaining something that is actually wrong. I'm afraid of showing that I'm ignorant about something that I thought I was knowledgeable about." Or someone said, "I'm afraid of getting a question I can't even begin to answer." And there's a whole group of being judged, right? So, "I'm afraid of not being impressive enough." [music] "I'm afraid that everything I say becomes--" Is that music coming from somewhere? Is it me?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S2<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>05:34.208</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">I don't know.

That must have been a crazy hidden browser window [laughter]. Oh, my goodness. So speaking of nightmares happening, imagine that your [total?] speakers are connected to the audio system at a huge conference. Okay. Back. So people said, "I'm afraid of not being impressive enough. I'm afraid that everything I say becomes so messy that anyone can refute it. I'm afraid that no one learns anything and the people I'm talking to are starkly aware of it." Someone said, "I'm afraid of being exposed for the fraud I have always felt like." But each of us still forge through these fears every day. It's important for us to get good at sharing our knowledge with others and being able to talk about the work that we do. It's important for us to know how to help someone understand something new or to be inspired or motivated to do something different. It helps us in our daily lives, and it helps us get new jobs, and it helps us do better work. So my goal today is to help you reduce those fears for any spotlight, whether it's being on a physical stage, or talking to your team, or just having a really important one-on-one conversation. So for this talk, I've cherry-picked a few tactics that are relevant for any of those different speaking settings, and we're going to talk about finding the right words to say and how to practice them. We're going to spend a lot of time talking about feedback because it's crucial not just for the spotlight moments. We'll cover a little bit about prep and then we'll talk about how to celebrate giving a talk.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>07:11.947</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">All right. So what do you want to say? This is the section for people who, when they thought about their fears, figured out that they were afraid of not getting their points across or being boring or rambling. So creating a solid structure for your content is the best way to guide your audience through your topic. Structure helps you set expectations for what's next, strengthens your arguments, and keeps folks more engaged. It also gives you a foothold if you lose your train of thought or if a browser window starts playing music in the background and you need to catch up for yourself really quickly. All right. So when we get nervous, we often try to jump right into what it is that we're trying to communicate, but it's important to set expectations at the top. Why are you there in that spotlight? So even before you jump into your narrative structure, your thesis, make sure it's clear to the folks in the room. What are you going to cover? Why is this important to you or to them? What do you hope that they're going to walk away with? So by setting expectations at the front, your audience, no matter how big or small, will be primed for what you're going to say. You will open their ears and their brain and make it even easier for your information to land. By the way, you'll start noticing me doing the things that I'm talking about in the presentation. I can't tell you how nerve-racking it is to be talking about public speaking while trying to be looking good at public speaking.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>08:24.241</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">All right. So give yourself some structure. This could look like telling a story to get your point across, or this could look like a thesis statement followed by supporting arguments. So once you have the main nugget you'd like to communicate, think about what you'll need to back it up and help make it land. So when I've got a prepared thing to say, and more than like 10 minutes to cover it in, this is the structure that I like to use. This works for moments like explaining a decision to your team, or defending your choices about something, or giving a talk like this one. So I'll start with a landscape. So here's what exists. Then I'll provide some analysis. So here's what I see about that landscape. Then my problem statement. So at the core is this issue. Here's some options. Here's what we can do. I like to provide a lot of terrible options in that list because I want to really emphasize-- here's a solution. Here's the best option, and here's how it works, and why you should believe me as I'm giving you this story, and then the bigger idea. So why should this concept matter to my audience, even if it's irrelevant to their particular work?<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>09:24.349</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So take a second. Where do you think we are in this narrative structure? We're like here, but also kind of here. So you'll see that we'll weave back and forth through this. I built this talk so that it resonates with people struggling with different kinds of fears and also different kinds of spotlights. So once I determined that my point was that we all can and should be able to use our fears about public speaking to level up our game, I workshopped a narrative structure to support it. So once I had that basic structure nailed down, I iterated on that narrative to make sure it wasn't just a dry list of information. Because just saying words at you doesn't mean it's going to land, right? You could list your work for your boss, or your professor when you ask for something, or just email a design to your client and hope that they get why it's the right direction, but you know better. It takes some extra magic to help your audience really hear you or believe you. So let's talk through the stuff we can do to level up our content to make sure it's not just informational but that it has that chance of landing.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>10:19.307</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So you may think it's smart to tell a joke. Firstly, jokes are terrifying. Don't feel like you have to be funny. Be yourself. But in the drier parts of any talk I'm giving, I'll see what I can incorporate to spice things up. So in this picture, I'm telling a story of a time when I didn't document an icon web font well, and it caused maybe the most hilarious bug in ANSI history. That horse head showed up in star ratings for our users. So I didn't need to tell that story on stage. It wasn't entirely relevant to my talk about how to make websites fast, but my talk was really dry in the part about web fonts, and I knew that I would lose some people from boredom. So I was able to put web font tactics on pause for a minute to tell the story, which kept people laughing and engaged throughout the end of the talk. And the best part is, I laughed on stage when I told the story. It was authentic. It was really ridiculous and I think it really helped that I was grinning and laughing on stage. I do this throughout my spotlight moments. It can be subtle and secret, like adding a post-it note to your laptop when you open it up with a message from your partner or a picture of something that makes you smile. Or it can be woven into your narrative structure, like my story about that horse head or these pictures of sloths. I can't help but grin when I see this sloth named Buttercup. I'm a better speaker when there's something in my talk that makes me feel really good and that means my message lands a lot better with my audience too. But it is really important to not distract your audience. So when I told that story about horses, or when I incorporated Buttercup, I was able to weave it in in a way that mostly made sense. I ensured it wasn't a distraction to folks and it didn't feel like I was going off tangent.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>11:56.357</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Unfortunately, when we incorporate humor, or imagery, like Internet memes, we open ourselves up to alienating folks. I'm going to bet that we've all been in that meeting when someone used an inappropriate image to make their point without realizing how distracting that might be for those in the room. So if you choose to make a joke, or you use some imagery as part of your spotlight moment, triple check that it's not going to accidentally offend or distract somebody. The last thing you want is the person who's listening to you to be caught off guard or triggered. And when I'm using imagery, I want to make sure that this imagery is as inclusive as possible. So I want to use quotes and pictures from a diverse set of humans and animals. Because I think it's the responsibility of the person with that soapbox, who's in that leadership position, to use that spotlight for good.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>12:40.394</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So think about what clothing would get you in the mindset for that moment. What would make you feel like a superhero? What would make you feel the most strongest, most secure, and most grounded while in that spotlight? What I wear in that spotlight tends to make me feel like a slightly dressier version of myself. It'll hold up to whatever the stage lights are. And if I have to wear a battery pack, it'll hold up to the weight of that. It usually doesn't make too much sound when I move. It'll hide my flop sweat. I try to look like I'm taking the event seriously. And the most important thing for my own fears, I want to make sure I'm wearing shoes that I'm probably not going to trip and fall in.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>13:13.789</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">All right. So practicing and getting feedback. This is my number one recommended trick to get better at public speaking. Practice what you want to say in front of a small, chosen group of people, and help them give you better, actionable feedback to help you level up your game. So doing this work of practicing your words and your body language, and soliciting feedback on it from that trusted group, will help us all be stronger at this. Though you may not have a lot of reason to practice this particular bit in your day-to-day work, I wanted to really go into detail on the feedback bits. Because giving and receiving feedback is a key part of our roles in humanity, but we're mostly terrible at it. So humans, by and large, are terrible at giving feedback. We're also really bad at preparing ourselves to receive feedback. This is true no matter the situation, hearing that we do something at home that drives our partner crazy, or our co-worker, or our boss. And most of us are paralyzed by the fear of having these awkward conversations. We actively avoid asking for feedback because it's just so painful sometimes. Or we'll go out of our way to give non-specific, general feedback sometimes via what some like to call compliment sandwiches, where you sandwich some constructive criticism in between two compliments in the hopes it'll soften a blow. So like, "Hey. You look great. You really screwed up that thing on Friday, but you're really smart." That's a terrible compliment sandwich. Avoid that at all costs.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>14:36.333</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So in the next section, I want to help encourage you to overcome your fear of asking for feedback and help people give you specific, actionable, and truly helpful feedback. So I'm going to keep on using the example of getting feedback on some prepared words to ground us in specifics, but I'm hopeful that this is going to help you in any circumstance you encounter in life. All right. So first, pick your feedback crew. Draw from your co-workers, your friends, and your other peers. I like to limit it to three or four people, at least at first. It's helpful if they're people that you already know are good at giving feedback or folks you share a similar context-- someone who knows your team, or your client, or your boss, or whoever you want to say these words to. Don't just pick people who you know are going to speak highly of you, though, because we want to learn how to get better, and these people need to give your trustworthy and honest opinions back to you. So the obvious choice for getting feedback is in person, right? But if practicing in front of people is less than comfortable, but you'd like feedback on narrative, or word choice, or some other non-body-language stuff, consider recording a dry run privately and then asking for asynchronous feedback from your crew. So my co-worker practices alone, records his talk on his computer, and then sends it to others to get their thoughts via email. So this lets him dedicate time and focus to each separate activity, practicing and then receiving feedback. And it gives him the mental space to shift gears in between. But if you choose to practice your words in person, this is your chance to gather non-verbal feedback and practice reading a room. So this is a photo of two audience members during one of my conference talks. I hope that you all feel as engaged right now as they look in this picture. So as you're practicing with others, watch how people respond. Do they laugh? Do they lean towards you and look focused? Are they nodding? Or do they look kind of confused or distracted? By tracking this kind of feedback, you'll develop a sense about which parts of what you're saying are more engaging, or move too quickly, or should be further workshopped. The first time I actually gave this talk in my office with my feedback crew, one of my co-workers fell asleep, which is really good feedback, right? I was able to know which parts were especially boring and I needed to fix.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>16:41.651</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">And before I move on, this slide image is really sneaky. I didn't know these guys very well at all when this picture was taken. It was at a Velocity conference some years ago, but that guy on the right is now my partner, so when I'm able to see his face on my screen, I'm like, "Aww." I smile and I'm a better presenter for it. So it can be nerve-racking to request feedback, let alone on something as personal and anxiety-inducing as public speaking. It's key to set expectations for your feedback-givers and prepare yourself to absorb their notes. Do the same for your feedback crew. Give them details about the point that you want to make, who your audience will be, and what kind of feedback you're looking for. Here are just a few examples of the kinds of things you can ask your feedback crew to think about as they listen to you practice. By priming their brains ahead of time, and cluing them into the kinds of feedback you're looking for, you'll both equip them well to help you and make sure you're ready to hear the kinds of things that they're going to say.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>17:35.323</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So for this prepared talk, I wanted to make sure that the flow of the content made sense and it didn't jump around too much. So when I practiced, I asked my crew to just pay special attention to whether or not I was building the information in a way that flowed. So when you're doing this practice run, don't stop if you fumble your words or make a mistake. Lots of us instinctively restart when we mess up during a run-through. We'll fumble our words or something, and then stop, and then sigh. And I know there's that little voice inside all of us that wants us to wallow for a minute when we mess up. That voice wants us to just settle into that defeated feeling while practicing. But you can't get stuck there. You've got to push on through. Practice making those mistakes and then recovering from them. Work on reducing that fear of messing up by getting to the end a bunch of times. If you're able to work through a mistake in a practice run, you're going to have confidence you can do so again should it happen once you're in that spotlight. So after the run-through, thank your crew and take a moment to shift your brain into feedback-receiving mode. Let your crew know how you'd like to receive their thoughts and when. Maybe you're energized. And that practice talking, you want to high five and dive right into the conversation then and there. Or maybe you're a little drained and you're not ready for feedback just yet. And it's totally okay to request comments separately and in a different medium. You can ask people to email you or talk about it over coffee later. You can even create an anonymous form for folks to fill out. Whatever makes you feel comfortable, and thus more receptive to their feedback. So remember, we're working on reducing that fear, and your feedback crew is going to want to help and support you.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>19:04.729</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So have you ever had someone tell you, "You did a good job"? Feels good for like a minute. But then you might wonder like, "Wait. What about that was good? What should I keep doing? Is there anything I could do even better?" What we crave is feedback that will help us grow, something to help make our message land, or for us to have more of an impact. Or to know specifically what it is that people value. So let's talk about how to get that kind of feedback from folks. A company called LifeLabs developed a way to think about feedback that uses suits of cards. So we've got general feedback, and specific and actionable feedback. We've got positive feedback, and we've got negative or constructive feedback. So hearts is feedback that's positive but not specific, like, "I really liked your talk." It's a very nice heart. But diamonds takes that feedback and makes it specific or actionable. So, "I thought your talk was funny, especially that joke about that joke about Buttercup. It held my attention." That's a solid diamond. Clubs, it's feedback that's negative but not specific or constructive. So someone might say, like, "I thought your talk was boring." Spades includes feedback that's negative but still gives specific suggestions. So, "My mind started to wander when you described the technical changes. Can you include more screenshots or other visuals to help keep the audience's attention?" That's a super-good spade. It's great shorthand for getting the kind of feedback you like. Explain this to your crew, and then ask them for diamonds or spades. Part of what makes diamond and spade feedback so valuable is that focus on the actionable item. It gives you something specific to respond to. If your feedback crew's sharing more hearts or clubs, ask open questions to turn their feedback towards the concrete. So for example, "Can you help me understand why I should include a code sample?" Or, "What specifically about that felt boring?" Or, "How can I make this more powerful?" I spoke at a sixth grade career day in New Jersey. And I got this feedback from a sixth grader, which was, "Miss Hogan was really fun and cool," which is a very nice heart. I would've loved to ask that sixth grader specifically what about me was really fun and cool. I really want to know.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>21:01.250</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So there's a chance that your public speaking moment will involve responding to surprise questions. Your boss, or your client, or your teammates, whoever you're talking to, they may have follow-up questions. How scary is this? We've spent so much time preparing our words and now we have to improvise. But don't worry. We can prepare for this too. So in that survey I talked about earlier, people said that they were afraid that they're not going to understand the questions or that someone will point out a hole in their premise that they entirely overlooked. Or they're afraid of being belittled because someone knows, or thinks they know, more about the speaker than they do on their topic. Have you ever attended a talk and actively rooted against the speaker? Probably not, unless you're a total sociopath, right? How have you felt when you watched a speaker get tongue-tied, or get asked a tough question, or lose their train of thought? It's painful to watch because, as humans, we have empathy. We for sure don't want that person who's in that spotlight to feel bad or to worry. If you've seen a presenter slip up, then you also know how great it feels to watch that speaker make a comeback and regain their composure, charging on to deliver their content. So remember, your feedback crew is here to help you, and so is your soon-to-be-real audience.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>22:11.965</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">A major breakthrough for me as an engineering leader was when I realized I could say, "I don't know," out loud and it could go extremely well. No matter how deep of an expert you are on a topic, there will always be questions that you're unprepared to answer. And frankly, whether it's an audience like this or an audience of your co-workers, saying out loud, "I don't know," is so much better than attempting to make up an answer. And there are many ways to say "I don't know," in a positive and encouraging way. I'll practice. "Oh, actually I don't know the answer to that question. I will look it up right after this and get back to you." Or, "Oh, that's interesting. I haven't thought about that." Or, "Who else could we ask to get an answer to that question?" Or in a conference setting or a major talk setting, I will sometimes straight up ask the rest of the audience, "If you know the answer to this question, could you raise your hand? Okay. You should go talk to that person after this is done." And if you're speaking to a larger audience like this one, remember that the goal of answering questions is not to make everyone happy, nor is it to teach material that's irrelevant to your point. For the most part, you are the person who is in charge whenever you're in the spotlight. You have a lot of power to reframe questions, to move on from weird questions, and do whatever you can to help the people listening continue to learn. So running a practice Q&A can help you vet your answers and phrasing. And to help you get comfortable saying, "I don't know," you can develop strategies and coping mechanisms for those key fears. So ask your feedback crew for some follow-up questions about your topic, and once you feel good on that front, you can level up your prep and ask them to give you tougher questions. Ask your test audience to imagine creative ways that people could misunderstand your point, or go on complete tangents, or give incorrect information, or bring up those typical arguments that go nowhere, like, "But isn't X a better language than Y?" Maybe they'll say something silly or really aggressive. Getting some practice handling this will help you feel more prepared for more surprises when you're finally in that spotlight. And frankly, this is usually the most fun part for your feedback crew.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>24:07.372</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">So after it's all is said and done, please be sure to go eat whatever your version of a donut is. So years ago, I found that whenever something awesome happened in my career - maybe I got published, or promoted, or launched a project - I wouldn't take the time to celebrate that achievement. I'm an achiever by nature, the kind who feels like every day starts-- so not deliberately marking these moments left me feeling like I wasn't actually accomplishing anything. "Oh, cool, that [list-a-part?] article went up," I would think, and then move on with my day. So once I realized that this was happening, I decided to be deliberate about marking achievements by eating one donut. Well, sometimes, more than one if it's a really big deal. But the act of donut-eating has actually helped me feel like I'm accomplishing my career goals because it forces me to take a minute with myself and focus on that accomplishment. Because donuts, to me, feel like a celebration. So as I started to share this idea with more people, I found that it resonated with others, especially young career-driven women who are routinely achieving goals and furthering their career but don't take the time to note their own success. So please find out what your version of donut is. Make sure that you are acknowledging yourself, the huge accomplishment of saying some prepared words under a spotlight. It is a really big deal, and you should be sure to celebrate that. So after you say the thing you want to say, and maybe you've answered some questions, maybe you've had your donut, it's important to gather some feedback, even if it's just from your own gut, to see what you can improve for next time. Because this won't be the last time that you say some prepared words to some people. As Raquel Vélez says, "Talks don't define you. You define you." Talks come and go, but every single one will make you a better you.<br />  </p></blockquote></div><div style="font-family:'calibri';margin: 35px 6.25% 0 0;font-size: 15px;line-height: 1.33;"><h3 style="float: left;margin: 0;">S1<br /><span style="color: #CCC;"><em style="display: inline-block;position: relative;top: 3px;margin-right: 1px;">~</em>25:42.779</span></h3><blockquote style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-left: 19.791666666666668%;"><p style="font-size: 16px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 16px;">Right. So what we need is a spectrum of voices. "Why do I care? Why am I traveling all over trying to share this stuff with people?" I believe, and I think that you all believe, that we do need that spectrum of voices, whether it's a kind of brainstorming session, and you see a brand new point of view, or it's a new coder view, where you learn a new technique that someone implemented. If you're a member of an underrepresented community, please know that I wrote the book on this stuff for you. It's built to help you get up on a metaphoric or a literal stage, and help you do this, to help keep you safe, and to help you to learn, and grow, and share with your boss or other higher-ups, with your team, or with your community. If you're not a member of an underrepresented community in this industry, please help those who want to get access to this information. We need diverse voices. We want to learn from their work and their insight, and we need that broader spectrum of voices to help us move forward as an industry. So please use these tactics to help those future leaders find that spotlight. We're definitely rooting for you. All right. That's it. I think it's time for questions.</p></blockquote></div>
