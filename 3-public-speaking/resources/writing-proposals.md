## Writing Proposals

Writing a proposal, aside from being needed to submit a talk to an external event, are also very useful guiding tools. Being able to articulate why your talk is valuable and what the audience will learn in a couple of paragraphs is a really useful guide to whether your talk will work. Even if you're delivering a talk to your group on campus, being able to write abstracts will help you advertise and explain the talk to your community.

So the first thing on your mind is probably "but what do I speak about?". One of my favourite quotes on talk topics comes from Sandi Metz. Sandi is a software developer, author and prolific public speaker. On preparing talks, Sandi says "think of you a year ago, and what you know now. Write the talk that you of a year ago would have been desperate to hear".

This is really powerful advice. As you yourself started out on the path to learn something, or build something, others have to start somewhere as well. Whilst we can never know 100% what journey everyone has been on to reach their current experience level, we know everyone has to start somewhere. If you pick two points on the journey between zero knowledge and expertise, and write about the movement between those two points, your experiences will inevitably be useful to someone else making the same move.

So how do you go about writing a proposal? GitHubber Katrina Owen is a prolific public speaker, and has given some incredible talks at well known conferences. Katrina has the following to say about writing a proposal:

### Put your audience first.

Identify who can benefit most from your story. Even if it’s a first-person experience, tell it to those individuals in a way that helps them connect with it. Make them feel like they’re a part of your experience by framing it in terms of similar experiences they might have and what they can do with the information you’re sharing.

### Set the stakes.

Establish a problem you’re addressing and why people should care. This is separate from the solution. Your audience will only care about a solution if you set up the problem in a way that helps them understand it and apply it to their experiences.

### Work towards a solution.

After your audience understands the problem, help them understand how to approach it and what’s novel about your approach. It’s ok if you don’t have it all figured out, but make your experience actionable for others and describe possible solutions.
