# Write a talk proposal

A talk proposal is needed to submit your talk to conferences or meetups, and is a useful tool for your own marketing and promotion. In this exercise we'll prepare a proposal.

## Task

- Come up with a talk topic. This can be something based on your current expertise or learnings, or [something you want to learn and speak about in the future](http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/starting-with-nothing.html).
- Follow the suggested structure by Katrina Owen in the README.md.
- You can find additional tips [here](http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html) and [here](http://speaking.io/plan/writing-a-cfp/).
- Submit your proposal using the process below.

## Stretch goals

You've written an proposal, why not submit it to a conference?
- Check out [Papercall](http://papercall.io), [Technically Speaking](https://tinyletter.com/techspeak) or [Eventil](https://eventil.com) to find places to submit your talk.
