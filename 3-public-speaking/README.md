## Introduction 👋

Getting in front of a room full of people can be a daunting task. But public speaking can be one of the most effective ways of sharing knowledge and inspiring action, whether that's in a team meeting, in front of your peers on campus, or at an international conference. In this module, you'll learn from Lara Hogan, author of _Demystifying Public Speaking_, on how to make that journey into public speaking. The talk we're about to move into was presented to the Spring 2017 cohort of Campus Experts, and provides fantastic coverage of speaking. You can expect to learn about imposter syndrome, getting effective feedback, classy humour, narrative structure, and even how to dress.

_You can find an annotated transcript of the talk in the [resources](resources/) directory_
