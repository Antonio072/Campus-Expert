## Introduction üëã

In this module, you'll learn about how to manage teams of people using GitHub Organizations. The lessons and advice in this module is drawn from how GitHub itself functions: we run the whole company on GitHub Organizations!

This talk will cover getting set up with an organization, creating teams, and advice on how to communicate. The communication style we talk about in this module is _asynchronous_ communication. It is particularly important for large or remote teams.

Campus Experts is a great example of these principles put into practice.

## Exercise

The exercise in this module is to create a GitHub Organization for your club, hackathon or other student group.
