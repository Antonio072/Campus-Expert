# Create a GitHub Pages Site

GitHub Organizations are a great way to communicate & work as a team. In this exercise, we'll create an organization for our student group, and take the first steps to making it a productive and useful tool.

## Task

The task for this module is to create a GitHub Organization that can be used by your student group to communicate and plan activities. There are lots of ways to do this, and no approach fits any one org, so you should think about what facilities your organization needs, and make use of the features mentioned in the module video. Below is some suggestions on how to get started.

Once you've set up your organization, write how this organization will be used in your student group. Here are some questions to get you thinking:

- How are your teams structured?
- How are tasks assigned and tracked?
- What information is public, and what is private?
- What could be automated using the API?
- What are your contribution guidelines?

Include this write up and a link to your organization in a file called "module-15.md".

### Getting started with an Organization
- Create a [new organization](https://github.com/organizations/new) on the free tier.
- [Create a team](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-team/) for your committee or leadership group.
- Create your first repository, you could call it "welcome" or "about". In this repository and it's README, talk about your student group, and how this organization will be used by it. You can follow Module 5 for some guidance on a great README! An example of this kind of repository is https://github.com/campus-experts/welcome.
- Create a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/) to make sure everyone working together is on the same page.
- Assign the team you created to ["write" permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/) for the repository.
- Create a [GitHub Project](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/) to organize your tasks.
- Create a [GitHub Page for your Organization](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/), to display information for your members. Check out Module 14 for tips on how to make a great Pages site.
- Use [GitHub's GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/reference/object/organization/) to pull the list of members for your repository. Check out Module 8 for some other ideas!
