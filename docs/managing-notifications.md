# Managing Notifications

This repository generates a lot of notifications. Before you get started, you should change your settings to save your inbox. Here are some tips:

- You can find your notifications in GitHub [here](https://github.com/notifications).
- Change your [email notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications)! This is a very active repository and will cause a lot of email notifications.
- You can route emails from a [GitHub organisation to a separate email address](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-emails-for-organizations/), if you only want to change the notifications you receive from Campus Experts.
- You can unwatch this repository. This is the least recommended option.
- [Mike McQuaid](https://github.com/mikemcquaid) wrote a blog post about [managing large number of GitHub notifications](https://github.com/blog/2399-managing-large-numbers-of-github-notifications).
- As you use GitHub more, you may find [Octobox a useful tool](https://octobox.io/) for getting and reading notifications.

Additionally, by default, you will be subscribed (watching) every fork of this repository. You can disable that at the top of the [notifications settings page](https://github.com/settings/notifications).
