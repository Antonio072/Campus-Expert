# Review and Response

## What happens when you submit an exercise?

When you submit an exercise, a member of the GitHub Education team, or an existing Campus Expert, will review. Depending on which exercise, reviewers are looking out for certain things during review. If your exercise is complete and ready to be merged, they will approve, and you'll be able to merge the pull request when you're ready. For Module 0, the reviewer will merge the pull request. For other modules, you as the submitter will merge, as you may want to make changes based on comments from the reviewers, even if approved.

## A reviewer asked me to make changes, but they still approved a merge, what do I do?

Sometimes reviewers will ask further questions or suggest changes, but approve the pull request anyway. This typically means that the changes requested are minor or advisory, and although it might be better if you included them, you could merge right away. Equally, the changes may be minor enough that the reviewer doesn't consider it worth blocking the merging of the pull request.

## How long should I expect to wait for a review?

We review submissions as fast as we can. Some modules submissions take longer than others, typically Module 1 takes the longest to review. Sometimes, external factors may influence the amount of time to review. When this is the case, you can find details in the "Review notices" section below.
