# Procedure for Handling Violations

If you feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, and would like to talk to a member of staff, then please follow the following steps so that we can help you as quickly as possible:

(This procedure has been adopted from the [London API code of conduct](https://github.com/phalt/londonapi-code-of-conduct), itself adapted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)".)

1\. Members of the Campus Experts team prepared to handle an incident are identified below. All of our staff are informed of this code of conduct policy and guide
for handling Code of Conduct violations in the repository.

2\. Report the Code of Conduct violationto a staff member. All reports are confidential. Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the staff have had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is as much for your safety and protection as it is for the other students.

When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available but do not
interview people about the incident. Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

- Identifying information (GitHub handle/link to where it occurred) of the participant violating the CoC.
- The behavior that was in violation.
- The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made).
- The circumstances surrounding the incident.
- Other people involved in the incident.

The staff are well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation.

**Note**: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they will not be tolerated. The silver lining is that, in many cases, these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better. The Campus Experts team requests that they be your first resource when reporting a Campus Experts-related incident, so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution.

If at all possible, all reports should be made directly to the Campus Experts team mentioned above.

## Staff Procedure for incident handling

All Campus Experts team members will have been briefed on the following procedures for helping you to help with your safety.

(This procedure has been adopted from the [London API code of conduct](https://github.com/phalt/londonapi-code-of-conduct), itself adapted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled "[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports)".)

Please make sure that you and other organisers have read this document in its entirety to ensure everyone helping to triage this repository is aware of the code of conduct and it's procedures.

Try to get as much of the incident in writing from the reporter. If you cannot, transcribe it yourself as it was told to you. The important information to gather include the following:

 - Identifying information (GitHub handle/link to place incident occurred) of the participant violating the CoC.
 - The behavior that was in violation.
 - The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time the report was made).
 - The circumstances surrounding the incident.
 - Other people involved in the incident.

Prepare an initial response to the incident. This initial response is very important and will set the tone for Campus Experts. Depending on the severity/details of the incident, please follow these guidelines:

 - If there is any general threat to students or the safety of anyone including staff is in doubt, alert the GitHub Security team or law enforcement.
 - Offer the victim a confidential video call.
 - Ask the victim "how can I help?".
 - Provide them with your list of emergency contacts if they need help later.
 - If everyone is presently physically safe, involve law enforcement or security only at a victim's request.

There are also some guidelines as to what not to do as an initial response:

 - Do not overtly invite them to withdraw the complaint or mention that withdrawal is OK. This suggests that you want them to do so, and is therefore coercive. "If you're OK with it [pursuing the complaint]" suggests that you are by default pursuing it and is not coercive.
 - Do not ask for their advice on how to deal with the complaint. This is a staff responsibility.
 - Do not offer them input into penalties. This is the staff's responsibility.

Once something is reported to a staff member, immediately meet with Joe Nash, the project manager. The main objectives of this meeting is to find out the following:

 - What happened?
 - Are we doing anything about it?
 - Who is doing those things?
 - When are they doing them?

After the staff meeting and discussion, have a staff member communicate with the participant alleged offender. Make sure to inform them of what has been reported about them.

Allow the alleged offender to give their side of the story to the staff. After this point, if the report stands, let the alleged offender know what actions will be taken against them.

Some things for the staff to consider when dealing with Code of Conduct offenders:

- Warning the violator to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in sanctions.
- Requiring that the offender avoid any interaction with their victim for the remainder of their participation in the program.
- Ending a talk that violates the policy early.
- Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy.
- Not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event now or in the future.
- Closing an issue or pull request that violates the policy.
- Not allowing a commenter who violates the policy to comment on issues or pull requests in the future.
- Immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the offended holds.
- Requiring that the offender not volunteer for future Campus Expert activities (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).
- Requiring that the offender immediately leave the project and not return.
- Banning the offender from future events and programs (either indefinitely or for a certain time period).
- Removing a offender from membership of relevant organisations and repositories.
- Publishing an account of the violation and calling for the resignation of the offender from their responsibilities (usually pursued by people without formal authority: may be called for if the offender is the event leader, or refuses to stand aside from the conflict of interest, or similar, typically event staff have sufficient governing rights over their space that this isn't as useful).

Give accused attendees a place to appeal to if there is one, but in the meantime the report stands. Keep in mind that it is not a good idea to encourage an apology from the offender.

It is very important how we deal with the incident publicly. Our policy is to make sure that everyone aware of the initial incident is also made aware that it is not according to policy and that official action has been taken - while still respecting the privacy of individual attendees. When speaking to individuals (those who are aware of the incident, but were not involved with the incident) about the incident it is a good idea to keep the details out.

Depending on the incident, the repository owner may decide to make one or more public announcements. If necessary, this will be done with a short announcement through the announcements issue, or project README. No one other than the repository owner or someone delegated authority from the repository owner should make any announcements. No personal information about either party will be disclosed as part of this process.

If some attendees were angered by the incident, it is best to apologize to them that the incident occurred to begin with.
