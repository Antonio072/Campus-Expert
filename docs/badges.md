# Campus Expert badges

## What are badges?

Every training module in the Campus Experts training has a badge. These badges are awarded to Campus Experts upon completion of a module. Once a student completes their application to be a Campus Expert, they are awarded the badges for the modules that make up their application.

## Where are badges displayed?

Badges are displayed on the Campus Expert's profile on the [Find an Expert site](http://githubcampus.expert).

## Why are they hexagonal?

The hex shape is actually a [defined standard](https://github.com/terinjokes/StickerConstructorSpec) for laptop stickers. This standard was created so that hackers and developers can tile their stickers together on their laptop. Many companies follow this standard with their stickers, including [Major League Hacking](https://twitter.com/mlhacks/status/714524094583025665). You can see more [here](http://hexb.in/sticker.html).

## Wait, does that mean we get stickers of these?!

Students who complete the application will have sticker versions of their badges sent to them! :tada:
