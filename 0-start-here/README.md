# Getting Started üöÄ

This module walks you through everything you need to be able to follow the GitHub Campus Expert training. Follow the steps below before progressing on to module 1 - the introduction.

_TIP: If at any stage during this (or future) modules, you need help or are stuck, you can find out how to get support in the "Support" section of the [README.md](./README.md#support-)._

**PRO-TIP** *This repository generates a lot of notications. Before you get started, you should change your settings to save your inbox. There are three options:*
- *Change your [email notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications)! This is a very active repository and will cause a lot of email notifications.*
- *You can route emails from a [GitHub organisation to a separate email address](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-emails-for-organizations/), if you only want to change the notifications you receive from Campus Experts.*
- *You can unwatch this repository. This is the least recommended option.*
- *[Mike McQuaid](https://github.com/mikemcquaid) wrote a blog post about [managing large number of GitHub notifications](https://github.com/blog/2399-managing-large-numbers-of-github-notifications).*

## Learning Goals ü•Ö

By the end of this module, you will:
- Have your own fork of the open-training repository.
- Have submitted your first exercise via a pull request.
- Have introduced yourself to the Campus Expert community.

## Meet the trainers üçé

The Campus Expert training features content from many creators. This content is maintained by Joe Nash, who welcomes requests for new training modules and talks!

## How does the training work?

- Each topic in the training is presented in a "training module".
- A training module looks just like this one: it's a collection of videos, written information and exercises that helps you learn about something useful to building a technical community.
- To complete a training module, you have to submit a solution to the exercises.
- Exercises for a training module can be found in each modules "exercises" directory.
- Check issues regularly! Issues aren't just for bugs, they're a great place to chat and start discussions. In Campus Experts, we use them like a forum!

## Getting ready to complete exercises

In order to complete an exercise, we will have to create what's called a _pull request_. To do this, we will need a _fork_ of this repository. A fork is our own copy of this repository. To create a fork, click the "Fork" button in the top right of the page.

After the fork is complete, you will find a copy of this repository under your profile. For example, the URL will be https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/open-training.

When we complete exercises, we will do it in our fork, and then request that those changes be merged into the original copy of the "open-training" repository. When our completed exercises are merged back into the training repository, we want to make sure they don't get mixed up with anyone elses, so we're going to start by creating our own space.

Navigate to the "submissions" directory. We are going to create a directory, and in it, we'll tell the community about ourselves. Start by clicking the "New file" button.

Once we've clicked "New file", we'll start by putting in the directory name. The name for this directory will just be your GitHub username, so go ahead and enter your GitHub username, followed by a trailing slash, "/". This tells GitHub that we're not done with this file name yet, and actually we'd like the file we're making to be inside a directory. Once you've done that, enter "about.md". So the full path should be "/submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/about.md".

We've named this file about.md because it is here that we're going to introduce ourselves to the other Campus Expert trainees. Tell us a little bit about yourself: what do you study, what community are you involved with, what's your favourite emoji? Please be mindful that the open-training repository is accessible to any student and to treat your private information as you would in any public space.

Once you've done that, scroll to the bottom of the page to find the "new commit" box. This is how we save this file: by creating a Git commit. Enter a short description such as "Introduced myself to the Campus Experts" and then hit the green button.

Although we've made this directory and this file, it currently only exists in our copy of the repository, our fork. Now we need to bring these changes over to the original repository. To do that, navigate to https://github.com/campus-experts/open-training. You will see at the top of the page there is a banner asking if you want to "compare and pull request".
Guess what? We do want to do that! So go ahead and click the green button.

A pull request is like asking for a review: we have made some changes to this repository, and now we'd like someone to look at those, and if they like them, accept those changes into the original repository. Once you've clicked the green button, you'll have the opportunity to describe your changes. You will see that the box has some information in it already: this is a template. Whenever we make a pull request to the open-training repository, we should follow this template so that the trainers can help and review our changes as quickly as possible.

Follow the template now, being sure to follow instructions about how to set the title and the correct labels.

Once you've done that, you can open the pull request. When your pull request is merged by a reviewer, your changes will be in the repository, and your directory will live alongside the other Campus Expert trainees! Congratulations, you've finished your first exercise.

## Completing an exercise

To get ready to submit exercises:

- Fork this repository.
- In your fork, in the "submissions" directory, create a new directory whose name is YOUR USERNAME.
- In this directory, create an "about.md" file. Tell the community a bit about yourself! (Remember: this information is public to all students)
- Navigate back to the ["open-training"](https://github.com/campus-experts/open-training) repository.
- Start a pull request, following the template to complete the title, description and labels.
- Open the pull request to merge in our about.md file.

To complete an exercise:
- Navigate to your fork, as a reminder, the URL will be https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/open-training.
- Navigate to the "submissions" directory, and find the directory with your username. Create it, if you haven't already.
- In the directory, create a new file. The filename will be described in the exercise you are following: it is usually the module name, for example "1-introduction.md".
- Fill the file with the contents of your completed exericse.
- Commit the changes.
- Navigate back to the original "open-training" repository.
- Start a pull request with your changes.
- Follow the pull request template to complete the title, description and labels.
- Wait for review!

## Keeping your fork in sync

As more content is added to this repository and more people contribute, your fork will fall out of date. This can sometimes lead to tricky situations with your pull requests. It's recommended to occasionally [sync your fork with this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
