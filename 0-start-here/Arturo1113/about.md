Hi! 
I'm José Arturo Vázquez Garduño. 
I'm studying computer engineering, I'm a member of GDG UNAM. 
My passion is technology and innovation, I believe that as a community we can create great things to change the world where we actually live in.
I think that everyone can learn from everyone something new and useful.
I love videogames too!
